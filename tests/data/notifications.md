  The Accidental Tech Podcast guys inspired me to change how I handle
  notifications for social media&mdash;silencing them all. So far, I like it
  a lot.
...

In [this week's episode][ep] of [Accidental Tech Podcast][atp], hosts Casey Liss
and John Siracusa mentioned that they have the sound aspect of notifications
disabled on their iDevices (Liss' iPhone, Siracusa's iPod Touch). Strange though
it might seem, the thought hadn't occurred to me. I like getting the notice of
things having happened on my social media accounts, but I'd concluded recently
that I actively disliked having the interruption even of a buzz in my pocket: it
forces a mental context shift which inevitably degrades my concentration on
whatever task I am about.

I spent ten minutes this evening and went through my iPhone's notification
settings. The only things which have audible or vibrating notifications now are
phone calls (including FaceTime) and text messages. Everything else I disabled.
Now, I still have notifications on a number of other items: they can show up in
Notification Center, and they can put markers on the home screen apps. After
all: if I already have my phone out, it is almost certainly no problem to see a
notification come in, and I definitely want to be able to glance at the app on
my home screen and see that someone has interacted with me in some way. But when
I *don't* have my phone out? It is unhelpful. It is distracting.

I actually turned on app badges for a number of apps for which I had previously
disabled them, because they had been extraneous when I was getting noises or
buzzes for the apps and services in question. I also tweaked a number of other
apps: some can show app badges but not appear in notification center. Most
cannot show anything on the lock screen at all. If I want to check on
notifications, I can look explicitly.

We will see how the experiment goes. Even just a few hours in, though, I can
already say I like it. I did *not* get any buzzing in my pocket when a few
people interacted with me on App.net, or Instagram, or anywhere else. And,
social media being what it is, none of those interactions are temporally
important (however much it might feel otherwise). They will still be there
waiting when I get back.

Now, this does not automatically make me more productive. I still need self
control to be most effective in using my time. It does take away a few of the
most obvious distractions and interruptions that make it hard to focus, though,
and that is *definitely* a win.
