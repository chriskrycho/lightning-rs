I like GitHub, generally speaking. It's a great piece of software, with a
vibrant community full of interesting people. It's still fairly easily the
best-designed site for hosting projects online.[^1] It has a lot of great
projects hosted on it. And it is *thoroughly* part of the broader startup tech
culture out there right now, in good ways and bad.

One of the bad (or at least not-good) parts of tech culture is how much of it is
*drinking* culture. Now, I like a good beer as much as the next gal or guy.[^2]
What I do not care for so much, though, is the way that drinking has become a
*de facto* standard in large segments of tech startup culture. (It's possible
it's equally *de rigueur* in other fields, but I wouldn't know: those aren't my
fields.) Case in point: I see a lot of these kinds of tweets:

Again, I like a beer. Having a drink with friends can be a really delightful
thing. But there are real, meaningful consequences to the ways we structure our
events. When the default way we spend time together is drinking (and, let us be
honest, getting drunk), that produces a predictable set of outcomes---many of
which are the sorts of things regularly decried but too rarely acted upon in the
tech community. If we want to reduce sexual harassment, for example, reducing
the drinking culture would probably be a step in the right direction: sober guys
may be jerks, but they are jerks whose social inhibitions are a bit higher, and
that's a *good* thing.

More broadly speaking, while I really do think alcohol is a good thing---a
genuine gift from our creator---I also recognize that centering a community on
it is unwise in the extreme. We build *culture* by the things we do as habits
over time, and culture does not shift easily.

[^1]: Bitbucket has made great strides in the last year, but it's still behind
    in terms of the cleanly nature of the UI, etc.

[^2]: Though of course, being enrolled in a Southern Baptist seminary and a man
    of conscience, I don't get to enjoy them at present... alas.
