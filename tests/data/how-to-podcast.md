I recently published [a long piece][podcasting-theses] on the costs and challenges of quality podcasting work. Some discussion with friends in various fora online suggested to me that it might be helpful to follow that up with an overview of the mechanics of doing podcasting well, as a guide for those new to the form or looking to tighten up their current process a bit.

Three caveats:

1. I'm not a professional, just a highly motivated amateur. (But then, probably neither are you.) Regardless, take this for what it's worth---there may be even *better* ways of tackling these issues, and if so I'd love to hear about them.
2. This is going to be long, probably at least as long as the original post.
3. {>> TODO: there was another one... <<}
