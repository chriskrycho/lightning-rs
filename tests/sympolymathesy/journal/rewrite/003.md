I’m starting building the visuals for the web view of [<b><i>re</i>write</b>][rewrite], and I want this system to be *easy* to work on. While actively avoiding [the infra engineer’s blind spot][blind-spot], I *do* want to engineer things well. I have concluded over the past few years that my preference is using (something like) [Atomic CSS][atomic-css]—with a slight twist. Atomic CSS typically emphasizes putting all those classes in your stylesheet. I prefer to use the atoms to define semantic class names instead, which represent a meaningful *composition* of those styles. This combines the reliability of an atomic CSS approach with the reusability of a more component-oriented design pattern. In other words, it combines the ideas of atomic CSS with the ideas of [atomic *design*][atomic-design].

Here’s what this looks like in practice, as I build out the design system for the first time today.

11:45
: I have *just* started. My CSS (technically [SCSS]) looks like this:

    ```scss
    
    ```
    
    (That’s not a mistake! It’s just literally empty, because I just started. It will fill up in the bits below.)

12:03
: I have some CSS now! In the interest of minimizing time spent on typeface choices today, I’m going with just using the system fonts, via [this lovely setup][system-font-css]. But it’s time for the first decision here: do I apply this to the `body` element, as a default? It’s definitely the *safest*, as then it “just works” everywhere else. However, it also means that everywhere else has to explicitly *override it*. This is probably for the best, and it’s probably what I want in the system in general.

13:39
: I’ve made no progress on this in the last 90 minutes, because refinancing a home is complicated and involves a lot of time with a spreadsheet and on the phone. I am, however, thinking about the appropriate mix of “componentization” vs. just using the atomic styles directly… and how what I actually want is the ability to define a reusable block of styles which simply *compiles* to . This is the promise of many CSS-in-JS libraries, and it makes a lot of sense. On the other hand, maybe I solve that by just defining it as functions which return those sets of class names on the *Elm* side.

16:18
: The refinance work squared away, and I’ve had a good long conversation with a friend familiar with both this project and CSS. My list of atoms is slowly growing:

    ```scss
    .type-system {
      font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
    }
    
    .fs-base {
      font-size: 16px;
    }
    
    .m-0 {
      margin: 1rem;
    }
    
    .p-0 {
      padding: 1rem;
    }
    ```

    It currently gets applied to the app like this:
    
    ```elm
    bodyClasses : Html.Attribute msg
    bodyClasses =
        class "type-system fs-base m-0"
    ```

    I have no idea whether I’ll end up keeping exactly these names (spoilers: I *probably* won’t), but the point today is to make progress. And I am!
    
    And my friend—humorously and kindly but not inaccurately described CSS as Crazy Stupid Stylesheets: “It’s wonderful, but also it’s crazy and kind of stupid.”

17:04
: I added these lines to my atoms—

    ```scss    
    .grid {
      display: grid;
    }
    ```

    —and I immediately began to think about what the grid system needs to *be*. (I’m perfectly content only supporting browsers which support CSS Grid with this app. There’s no reason *not* to, in fact: IE11 will be well and truly dead soon.) I need a grid *system*, with well-defined defaults for gaps, reflow sizes, etc.

17:27
: It’s time to go eat dinner, but I’ve made some progress: borrowing ideas from [Tailwind] and [Tachyons], I've started building out a grid system I find reasonable. I now have a bunch of declarations like this:

    ```scss
    .grid-cols-12 {
      grid-template-columns: repeat(12, minmax(0, 1fr));
    }

    @media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
      .med--grid-cols-12 {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(12, minmax(0, 1fr));
      }
    }

    @media screen and (min-width: 960px) {
      .wide--grid-cols-12 {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(12, minmax(0, 1fr));
      }
    }

    @media screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
      .x-wide--grid-cols-12 {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(12, minmax(0, 1fr));
      }
    }
    ```

    Those get applied like this, now:

    ```elm
    bodyClasses : Html.Attribute msg
    bodyClasses =
        class "type-system fs-base m-0 grid grid-cols-none wide--grid-cols-12"
    ```

    This makes it *not* use a set of grid template columns on smaller screens, 4 columns on “medium” sized screens, 8 columns on “wide” screens, and 12 columns on “extra-wide” screens. Note that this is a mobile-first approach! In my experience, if you start mobile-first, responsive design is if not *easy* then at least *very tractable*. If you start by assuming a large screen, designing back *down* to mobile is very hard.
    
    While this works reasonably well, I may also want to set a minimum size on those columns. We’ll see. I also don’t know yet if these sizes will work exactly right!
    
    The other important thing to notice here: many people use this kind of responsive grid to make a *fluid* grid system where things reflow dyanmically. This isn’t *quite* that: I’m aiming for a responsive flow, but not a totally fluid flow. Totally fluid flows work much better for *content*-oriented, rather than *application*-like web interfaces.

17:41
: That’s a wrap on this particular session. Hopefully it was somewhat interesting and illuminating for you; I enjoyed documenting my thoughts this way as I did it. It actually helped me keep making progress all day, even if the progress was slower than it could in principle have been!
