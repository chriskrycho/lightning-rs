After getting some revisions done [earlier in the day today][day-4-part-1], I was able to turn my attention to the next phase of this work, and the next (and probably final) major chunk of the piece of music. I spent a good bit of the evening noodling on the piano, playing over and over again through variations on the second riff I posted [at the end of the first day][day-1]. And standing on my deck, thinking—because I was *stuck* and the best way forward was standing outside in the quiet, watching some birds, pacing back and forth and running through the sound in my head, because I wasn't succeeding in getting it out into the piano (much less an orchestral score!).

Standing on my deck, pacing, playing the music in my head helped! When I went back to the piano, I was able to find a couple new interesting melodies—but then I was also able to find a new, better *rhythm*. This was the same basic process I went through for nailing down the sound for the opening fanfare on the morning of [the second day][day-2]: taking the melodic progressions I had come up with already and getting them into the right shape *rhythmically*. It's quite amazing how distinct the effect of the same sequence of pitches can be when set in different rhythmic relation.

I knew when I came back to the piano that I wanted to connect the sounds of the two sections a bit more directly—not just the harmonic patterns, but also the *feel* of them. The new rhythms I landed on do the trick nicely, as they're a kind of variation on the rhythms from the fanfare. The difference: I removed some triplets in favor of two rhythms I use in the fanfare: sixteenth-sixteenth-eighth, and a dotted quarter note followed by a quarter note. It's *much* improved.

With the new rhythms in place and a few new melodic and harmonic ideas (key change!), I also decided it would be helpful to survey the actual harmonies I ended up using in the fanfare, for easy reference. I fully expect to pull those back out more or less directly in this next section, and then to vary them.
