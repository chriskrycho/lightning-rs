Today, [SpaceX successfully launched][launch] a Falcon 9 rocket with the Crew Dragon capsule on top, with astronauts. I was, to say the least, [excited][atss]. This is one of those moments that doesn’t just come along every day!

The launch was originally scheduled for Wednesday, and [as I hoped][day-7], I was able to actually finish it on the day of the launch. Not quite early enough to have *shared* it with SpaceX via social media… but then, [I’m not on social media][breaking-up], so I don’t actually know how I would have done it anyway.

I have a few further comments, but first, the music!

## Further thoughts

Now that I have actually *completed* a draft of this piece, I have a bunch of further thoughts:

- [Title](#title)
- [Dorico](#dorico)
- [Orchestration](#orchestration)
- [Revising](#revising)
- [Recording](#recording)

### Title

You may have noticed if you looked at [the score][score] (today or previously) that the title on the page is <cite>Fanfare for a New Era of American Spaceflight</cite>. I titled the blog post series “Composing a Fanfare for Crew Dragon” because I did not actually have that title when I started work, but I like it. There is a long history of “Fanfare for…” and while this piece will never stack up next to something like Copland’s <cite>Fanfare for the Common Man</cite>, that’s at least the kind of thing I had in mind!

### Dorico

Scoring in [Dorico] is great! I’ve made good use of their 30-day trial, and I will definitely be purchasing [Dorico Pro][compare]. I intend to have a full review up in the next week or so, now that I’ve actually worked start to finish on a piece in it. The thing that continues to amuse me most is something that caught my attention within the first day or so of scoring with Dorico: despite not having used [Sibelius] in earnest in over a decade, I still reach for its keyboard shortcuts sometimes!

[compare]: https://new.steinberg.net/dorico/compare-editions/
[Sibelius]: http://www.sibelius.com

The next thing I’d really like to figure out is how to handle *playback* with a good deal more nuance. Dorico’s built in mapping from notation to MIDI expressions is very good, so this doesn’t sound terrible… but despite the quality of the [Halion Symphonic Orchestra][hso] (HSO) samples, this recording is not going to fool anyone that this is a real orchestra for even a second. To *really* make this sound the way I want, I think I would need to export it over to [Logic][Logic] (which I’m fairly familiar with, having used it for podcast editing for many years) and use a MIDI keyboard and actually learn all the ins and outs of MIDI expression mapping.[^hso-version] I would *like* to do that, but I honestly don’t think I *should* spend the time to do it as things stand: I have [other projects][rewrite] to work on!

[Logic]: https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/

*[MIDI]: musical instrument digital interface

[^hso-version]: What’s more, to make using a DAW like Logic pay off, I’d also need to invest in the full version of HSO (or something like it): the version that comes with Dorico Pro is VST-only, with no AU support. That is no joke price-wise, and while it would definitely be worth it if I were going to be doing this *all the time*… I expect to be composing a few times a year going forward, not week in and week out.

*[HSO]: Halion Symphonic Orchesetra
*[VST]: Virtual Studio Technology
*[AU]: Audio Unit

### Orchestration

I’m still going to plan to pick up an orchestration book. I’m reasonably pleased with how this came out—it is *substantially* the most interesting and careful orchestration work I have ever done—but I also found myself constantly aware of [my gaps here][day-2]. My current plan is to pick up one or both of the volumes recommended to me by a couple professors of music composition I trust:

- [<cite>Instrumentation and Orchestration</cite>][blatter], Alfred Blatter
- [<cite>The Study of Orchestration</cite>][adler], Samuel Adler

[day-2]: https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/crew-dragon-fanfare/day-2/
[blatter]: https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=qvtf8Hp8DGA&mid=2653&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2FInstrumentation-and-Orchestration-Alfred-Blatter%2Fbook%2F47448528%3Fmatches%3D17
[adler]: https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=qvtf8Hp8DGA&mid=2653&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2FThe-Study-of-Orchestration-Samuel-Adler%2Fbook%2F6423813%3Fmatches%3D43

Again: it’s not that what I did on this particular piece was *bad*. To the contrary! I’m proud of it, and particularly of the fact that I meaningfully *improved* my orchestration over [the last things][enanthropoisis] I wrote [for orchestra][destiny-and-hope].

Even so: working through some exercises would be helpful, I think. Perhaps even more importantly, getting a clearer handle mentally on the way that the pieces of the orchestra can work together in a technical sense would be *great*. I am profoundly grateful for my music theory classes—in this very piece I drew on things I learned about counterpoint in those classes almost fifteen years ago!—and I find in general that deep technical knowledge only *improves* one’s work in categories like this, at least once it is well and properly internalized.

### Revising

I expect to revise this a bit over the next few weeks. I will probably listen to it as it stands *way* too many times over the next few days, then give myself some time away from it. Much as with writing *words*, I find it helpful when writing music to do a draft, then get some space and distance, then come back to it. Right in the aftermath of finishing a draft, I am too close to the material and it is easy to be precious about it and attached to it.

I don’t *expect* that I’ll make any large structural changes to the piece when I come back to it… but of course, I *would* say that today: I just finished it, and I’m feeling *very* precious about it! A few weeks or a month from now, I might just hear some things that need to work differently.

### Recording

This is a long shot, but… if you happen to belong to (or lead!) an orchestra, and you like this piece enough that you would be interested in performing it, [*please* email me](mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com?subject=fanfare)! For all that I hope to eventually be sufficiently competent with a DAW like Logic for its intended purpose of music production, I would always infinitely prefer a live recording of real musicians playing my music.
