    - This Week I Learned

---

In April and May, inspired by [Reda Lemeden][rl], I experimented with posting a weekly summary of the things I’d read that week, under the heading [This Week I Learned][twil]. In practice it was less “This week I learned” and more “This week I read,” but that was fine. Pretty quickly, though, I ran into the same basic issue that led me to [stop][final] publishing [my newsletter][atss]: time.

This is a slightly ridiculous (but very typical for me) case of a self-created problem and a self-imposed stricture, but I wanted to *actually* summarize *everything* I’d read and thought valuable to my readers (or my future self). It turns out that doing that takes a lot of time. (Who knew?) The work of writing it up each week was taking me an hour or more. And after about a month or so, I decided I needed to spend that time on other things. So, while I really enjoyed the experiment, I bid it _adieu_.

Perhaps at some much less busy and much less stressful point in the future I’ll pick it up again—or perhaps not. One of the great and lasting joys of a blog like this one is that it need only ever be exactly what I want of it at any given time!
