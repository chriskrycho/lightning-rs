> The first \[requirement for thinking Christianly about God’s holiness] is that we need to understand that theological thinking *about* holiness is itself an exercise *of* holiness. Theology is an aspect of the sanctification of reason, that is, of the process in which reason is put to death and made alive by the terrifying and merciful presence of the holy God. Without sanctification—without being caught up by God and cleansed for the service of God in the fellowship of the saints—the work of theological reason is profitless.
