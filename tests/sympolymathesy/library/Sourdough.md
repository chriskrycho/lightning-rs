    summary: >
        I don’t remember the last time I had so much just plain *fun* reading a novel—and while contemporary settings rarely grab my attention this one did. Somehow Sloan manages to pull that off… while featuring a possibly-sentient sourdough starter and good-naturedly poking holes in Silicon Valley culture. Go read it. Right now!

When [Alan Jacobs][ayjay] recommends an author of fiction, you should take him seriously. Robin Sloan’s [<cite>Sourdough</cite>]({{book.link}}) is the second thing Jacobs has recommended that I’ve read—the first being Kim Stanley Robinson’s <cite>Red Mars</cite>—and in both cases I’ve come away more than happy that I heeded Jacobs’ advice.

<cite>Sourdough</cite> is not a complicated book. I think it’s sci-fi, barely. It’s definitely contemporary fiction: the setting is unmistakably Silicon Valley in the present—with all its many beauties and horrors. The fascination with hacking our way into the future (and the [ruthless optimism][ws] that we can do just that), the drive to put a particular class of technological advancement in front of every other human concern, the sheer unimaginable wealth involved in the pursuit of a technocracy perfected, and—especially—the confused notion that age-old human practices like *cooking* and *eating* and *spending time with friends* are outmoded and in desperate need of technological replacement: somehow, Sloan gets all of that in this slim little novel which made me laugh out loud more than any other book I can remember reading in the last decade.

Perhaps equally magical: he does it without a hint of malice or spite. “This is folly,” he seems to say, “but maybe the best way to make that clear is to laugh at it a bit and paint a picture of something lovelier still.” The result was a good novel, but a *great* book.
