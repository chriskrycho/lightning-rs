Iâ€™m in an archival mood this evening, so Iâ€™m exporting all my old [Sibelius][0] files into [Music<abbr title="extensible markup language">XML</abbr>][1] and [MIDI][2]: proprietary formats are bad for long-term storage!

Along the way, Iâ€™ve discovered music I wrote in the 2000s that I had completely forgotten about. ðŸ¤¯
