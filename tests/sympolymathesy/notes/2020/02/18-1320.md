One thing that makes me eager to upgrade to the next-gen iPad when it comes out (â€¦and Iâ€™m actually seriously contemplating the 12.9â€³ this time around) is how *fabulous* it is to be able to do the entire workflow for things like cameras on it with just normal cables.

It is already my default device for photo editing (Lightroom on iPad is ðŸ’¯) and I think itâ€™s going to be my default for podcast editing after having done [Winning Slowly](https://winningslowly.org) 8.03 in [Ferrite](https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/). (To anyone interested in podcasting, Iâ€™d absolutely recommend Ferrite over anything else out there at this point. The experience of editing a podcast with that app and an Apple Pencil is just phenomenal.)
