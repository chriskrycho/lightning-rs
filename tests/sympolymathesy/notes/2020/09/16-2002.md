[Mere Orthodoxy]—“defending nuance and word counts on the internet since 2005” and my favorite Christian publication anywhere period at this point—has launched a [Kickstarter]({{link}})! I’m proud to have been published in its pages a few times over the years, and hope that this crowdfunding campaign succeeds such that I can actually be published in its *physical pages* in the years ahead.
