Every so often, I try to switch back to [Sublime Text][ST] from [VS Code][code], because Sublime is *so* much faster and lighter-weight. But the feature gap is just too big at this point. What I still—desperately—want: an editor with Code’s extensibility, but truly Mac-native and *fast*. ([Onivim] and [Nova]: both interesting, but not quite there in various ways.)

[ST]: https://www.sublimetext.com
[code]: https://code.visualstudio.com
[Onivim]: https://onivim.io
[Nova]: https://panic.com/nova/
