Just finished reading Zeynep Tüfeçki’s utterly masterful <cite>Twitter and Tear Gas</cite>. The book is astonishing. It gave me better frames for thinking about a great many things I’ve been thinking about for a long time now, and it is a masterful work of academic scholarship presented in a way that just about anyone could read.
