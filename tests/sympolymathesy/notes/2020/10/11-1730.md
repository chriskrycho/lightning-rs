What I actually want for my website: an opinionated(-but-matches-*my*-opinions, of course) site generator written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) which acts like a static site generator but has a tiny server with [a tiny CMS](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-new-website-for-2020) and uses [Glimmer](https://github.com/glimmerjs) for its templating engine.

*[CMS]: content management system
