Started reading Mary Midgley’s <cite>Evolution as a Religion</cite> for the September episodes of [Winning Slowly](https://winningslowly.org). This is going to be quite the ride.

(Let’s just say that her grasp on the problems of evolution-as-religion is better than her grasp on the nature of religion itself.)
