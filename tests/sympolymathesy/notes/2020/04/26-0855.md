Between my new [This Week I Learned][TWIL] entries, an interest in having all my notes in one place, and a desire to actually *use* my notes system more effectively I’m trying something new with my reading: notable things I read (and my comments on them) will now live in [Bear] instead of [Pinboard]. I expect this will help a lot with *active review* of my reading notes. (I may go ahead and do something I’ve thought about for a while and pull all of my Pinboard notes over to Bear, too!)
