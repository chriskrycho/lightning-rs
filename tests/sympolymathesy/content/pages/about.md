Since there's enough to get by with on the front page, I assume you're here for the longer version, so… here we go!

If you're trying to figure out what in the world “sympolymathesy” means, I wrote about it [here](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/relaunch!/#1-new-site-title).

## First things first

Self-biographies are a bit weird. No two ways around it. But they *do* give us a chance to think about how we present ourselves to the world. So when I say—

<blockquote>
{% include 'blocks/short-about.njk' %}
</blockquote>

—well, the order is careful and the word choice precise. The first things on my personal bio—“a follower of Christ, a husband, and a dad”—are where they are because everything else on the list is both less important than those first three and profoundly informed by them.

### A follower of Christ

The single most important fact of my life is that, to quote [Saint Paul](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+6/): I am not my own, but I was bought with a price—and that price was the death of Jesus Christ, God-the-Son, in my place.[^on-1-cor-6]

I am specifically a Christian in the historic Reformed tradition—aiming always to be irenic, catholic, and orthodox. We’re glad members of [Forestgate Presbyterian Church][forestgate] in Northern Colorado Springs, where I serve in various lay leadership roles.

[^on-1-cor-6]: Paul was writing specifically about sexual immorality—but the form of his argument is to ground that specific injunction in a very sweeping, indeed a totalizing, claim about the Christian life.

### A husband and a dad

After following Christ, my family is far and away the most important part of my life. Jaimie and I got married in July 2009, and our daughters Elayne and Kate were born in May 2012 and May 2014.

## By trade

Since graduating college, I have been working more or less full-time in the software industry—starting out writing avionics software and then hazards and risk mitigation software for the energy industry while picking up web development on the side and eventually transitioning into web development full time. You can see my [CV](/cv/) for the nitty-gritty professional-historical details! Below are just the salient bits of what I’m doing *right now*.

### LinkedIn

I’m currently a Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn, working on front-end infrastructure for what most people think of when you say LinkedIn: the app you sign into, send messages and read updates on, etc. I’m currently supporting our adoption of [Ember Octane]—a project I’ve been doing prep work for in the app since August 2019. I also regularly work closely with a number of the Ember core team members on design of upcoming features, and since 2017 (well before I joined LinkedIn) I have been one of several people driving forward [TypeScript] adoption in the Ember community.

## By vocation

I have increasingly come to see much of my *calling* in life as that of the <i>public theologian</i>. Doing public theology means (at least) two things:

- doing theological work *for* the church *in* public
- doing theological work *from* the church *for* the public

When I am doing theological work *for* the church *in public*, I aim for the good of the church. It is not merely for intellectual interest; when it is, I’m off the rails. The point of this kind of public theology is to equip other Christians to think well: God and his work in our world, and of our right response to his work.

When I am doing theological work *from* the church *for* the public, I aim for the good of the world in which the church is set. As with work for the church, this cannot be merely a matter of satisfying my curiosity. It also cannot be done *solo*: “public theology” done outside the church—that is, not *from* the church—is also off the rails. My aims in this mode are to make Christianity intelligible to those for whom it is simply perplexing, and to apply robustly Christian thought to matters of the day.

These two modes are complements—not competitors. Done well, each benefits the other.

## By hobby

### A writer

Since college, I have written—a *lot*—primarily on various iterations of chriskrycho.com, but also occasionally at [Mere Orthodoxy], and between January 2018 and June 2020 also in [my newsletter]. I increasingly conceive of my public writing along two axes:

[Mere Orthodoxy]: https://mereorthodoxy.com
[my newsletter]: https://buttondown.email/chriskrycho

- <i>public theology:</i> writing in line with that vocation of <i>public theologian</i> is the work that I care most about, though it is also the work that is hardest in many ways: it’s where the bar is highest.

- <i>public learning:</i> encouraging a culture of learning by sharing what I’m learning—both so that the things I learn, others gain benefit from, and so that I myself have a good trail to follow in the future!

### A runner

Since 2010, I have been a long-distance runner. A bout of mono left me incredibly weak, and a desire to get back in shape to play [Ultimate] with friends led me to spend a lot of time running over the next year. The running stuck: I *miss* playing Ultimate, but nothing stops me from running regularly. I’ve also completed a super sprint triathlon, and cycle regularly… but running is my favorite.

### A podcaster

In January 2014, my long-time friend [Stephen Carradini] and I launched [Winning Slowly]—a podcast about tech, religion, ethics, and art. He calls it a tech podcast with other angles; I call it our excuse to talk about literally every part of human existence. We’re both right. And you wouldn’t be wrong to see it as another spot where I consciously practice <i>public theology</i>.

[Winning Slowly]: https://winningslowly.org

Out of that initial experiment (still running!) grew a general interest in podcasting as a medium, and a variety of podcasts I’ve hosted over the years:

- [New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com)—my 3½-year-long podcast about the Rust programming language, in which I tried something that as far as I know no one else had done before: teaching a programming language through a podcast.

- [Sap.py](https://sap-py.krycho.com)—an early foray into podcasting with my wife during her brief experiment learning Python

- [Run With Me](https://runwith.chriskrycho.com)—an experimental “microcast” (with episodes always under 10 minutes long), recorded *while running* at various points in 2016.

- [Mass Affection](https://massaffection.com)—another foray into podcasting with my wife, this time about the video game series <cite>Mass Effect</cite>. We aspire to finish this… eventually. It’s been hard to carve out the time for it the last couple years, but we always enjoy it when we do!

I find podcasting a great complement to writing. It is available in spaces and places where people cannot read (like commuting), and it’s also a great place to flesh out thoughts I have already put in writing or am trying to figure out how to put in writing.

### A composer

In high school and college, I studied and practiced musical composition, mostly in a neoclassical/neoromantic vein. Since graduating college, I have composed relatively little, but it remains a delight when I get a chance to do it. I composed the processional for my own wedding as well as both of my little sisters’ weddings and the themes for all of my podcasts, and actually have a few things actively in work (if on the back burner). You can check out a limited sample of my work (which I hope to expand soon, for the curious if nothing else) [on SoundCloud].
