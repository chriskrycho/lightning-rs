I can’t really listen to podcasts or watch talks and *work* at the same time. I also can’t watch talks and walk or run at the same time. What I *can* do is *listen* to talks and walk or run at the same time. But there are a lot of great talks I want to learn from!

Solution: [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) plus [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) Premium’s file uploads feature. Boom.
