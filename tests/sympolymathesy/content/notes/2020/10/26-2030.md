I started reading [<cite>Mr. Penumbraâ€™s 24-Hour Bookstore</cite>](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=qvtf8Hp8DGA&mid=2653&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2FMr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Robin-Sloan%2Fbook%2F21924389) tonight and even a chapter in, I am just delighted. (I feel obliged to ask: is Mr. Penumbra a secret alias for Mr. Rogers?)
