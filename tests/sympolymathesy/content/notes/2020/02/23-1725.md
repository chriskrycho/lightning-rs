I’ve spent a good chunk of this afternoon working through and tweaking and fixing some things about this website, and as much as I like [11ty](https://11ty.dev), at this point I would *love* to be doing this work in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) instead. A tool like [elm-pages](https://elm-pages.com) seems *very* appealing.

As for why: I just spend a lot of time sad about JS “sorry bro that’s `undefined`” stuff and templates being totally type-unaware. Even something like Gatsby + TS would probably be better here, but Elm’s rigor and top-to-bottom integration of types and rendered HTML and CSS would be a huge win for the way I build websites.

*[JS]: JavaScript
*[TS]: TypeScript
*[HTML]: HyperText Markup Language
*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets
