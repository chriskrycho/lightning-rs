This is, perhaps, a little odd, but: one of the little things I’m most excited about with [Winning Slowly](https://winningslowly.org) right now is that—at long last, and years overdue—we’re actually *doing something* with Patreon. We’ve had it, and had minor benefits for it for a long time. Now we’re taking it seriously: keeping it up to date, publishing extra materials there, etc. Crazy talk, I know!
