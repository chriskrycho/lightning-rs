Iâ€™m not *quite* sure how this had never occurred to me before the last week or so, but I ordered some refills for [my current favorite gel pen](https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-UMR-83-Gel-Pen-Refill-0.38-mm-Black/pd/1660) and it only at that point occurred to me that I could put those refills in a different pen *case*. ðŸ˜‚ At some point Iâ€™ll have to try that.
