*CSS Grid blowout.*
: [This article][blowout] has a great summary of a thing I had to figure out the hard way a couple days ago to fix the behavior of the [Notes] section of this site. Grid columns default to having the minimum width of their content, `auto`. This is reasonably fine for lots of kinds of items, but for images (`<img>`, pre-formatted text (`<pre>`), description/definition lists (`<dl>`) and likely others… not so much. Setting a concrete value with `minmax(0em, <max value>)` does the trick—and it doesn’t have to be `0em`; *any* minimum value will do it.

*Conspiracy theories.*
: Ellen Cushing [details][conspiracy] both how she ended up deep in conspiracy theories as a teenager, and how she eventually ended up gradually slipping out of that world. HT: [Alan Jacobs' Pinboard][ayjay]. I've been (we've *all* been, I expect) encountering more and more conspiracy-theorizing over the past few years, and never more so than since the arrival of COVID-19. This was a helpful and illuminating piece—even if it's as unclear as always with memoir-style write-ups how much this one person's experience generalizes to the masses: Cushing represents the person who ended up *recovering* from conspiracy-mind, while there are many others for whom it only gets worse over time. There is hope here, but it is of a limited sort.

*Birds.*
: I've been watching the birds behind our house more and more over the last couple years. This year, we have a *bunch* of kinds of birds I've never seen before, and it has been fascinating to see each different species' different behaviors. I'm not quite the bird-obsessive that my wife is (or that our cat is, albeit for very different reasons!), but I find them endlessly fascinating nonetheless. Jenny Odell's [double-review][birds] of David Allen Sibley's <cite>What It's Like to Be a Bird: From Flying to nesting, Eating to Singing—What Birds Are Doing, and Why</cite> and Jennifer Ackerman's <cite>The Bird Way: A new Look at How Birds Talk, Work, Play, Parent, and Think</cite> only increased my fascination. Birds do some pretty remarkable, pretty strange things.

*Hacking.*
: Andy Greenberg with [the absolutely wild story][hacking] of Marcus Hutchins—a hacker who did some pretty terrible things as a [black-hat] in his mid-teens, but who has since done enormous good as a [white-hat]. There's a eucatastrophic bit at the end-so-far of this story that had me delighted.

*Lynching.*
: Malcolm Foley [writes piercingly, wrenchingly, and with serious theological weight at <cite>Mere Orthodoxy</cite>][lynching] on the killing of black men, women, and children under the pretext of justice—prompted by the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. (As my friend and the editor-and-chief at Mere O Jake Meador [made abundantly clear with straightforward moral reasoning][jake]: *whatever* Arbery was doing, and even in the *worst* possible light for him and the *best* possible light for the men who killed him, the killing was a murder.) Foley's piece unflinchingly looks at the legacy of lynching in the church, and calls the church specifically to do *better* here.

    > So then what can we do moving forward? Is there still a way for the church of Christ to be a beacon of hope in the midst of the encroaching and oppressive darkness of white supremacy? There are two: we must read our Bibles differently and we must act in our world differently.
    > 
    > Being a confessional Presbyterian, I have found much hope and beauty in the Westminster Standards. When asked why I, as a black man, attempt to remain in a communion which historically was the architect of my ancestors’ enslavement, I respond that I am so because of its doctrine and polity and in direct resistance to its history.

    Amen.
