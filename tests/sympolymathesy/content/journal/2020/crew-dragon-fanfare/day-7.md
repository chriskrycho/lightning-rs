Although I failed to post about it (because we got busy doing other things), I *did* make more progress on this fanfare on Memorial Day. Sadly, I did *not* make any further progress after that and before the scheduled Crew Demo 2 launch… but it got scrubbed because there was too much electrical energy in the air. (Nobody wants a repeat of the time Apollo 12 got struck by lightning and experienced a brownout on its electrical circuits!)

I sat back down with the score tonight and made some tweaks to what I had done by the end of the day Monday, filled out a bunch of the orchestration, and then worked out another 8 seconds worth of music. Yes, just 8 seconds! With full orchestration, this stuff takes a while—at least for me.[^speed]

[^speed]: I’m sure that people who do this for a living can do it far faster than I can! I also have to say: Dorico makes this work go quicker than Sibelius ever did, but I’m definitely still developing the muscle memory for it!

At this point, it’s getting down to the home stretch. The orchestration in this final section is thickening out just the way I wanted; I’ve managed roughly the amount of thematic variation and development I was hoping for; it’s building to the climax (and I know roughly how that should work). If I work *really* hard tomorrow and Saturday morning in between other things… maybe I’ll finish it by the time they *actually* launch on Saturday.

Without further ado, here’s what I have as of tonight!
