Yesterday, [Chris Garrett](https://pzuraq.com) ([@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq)) and I spent an hour talking about how autotracking and the Glimmer/Ember template layer connect. As the tech lead for Octane on the LinkedIn.com app, I needed to get a better handle on this so I can help *explain* it (and for a blog post I'm working on!). But it's useful for *anyone* who wants to understand more of Glimmer works—so I’m delighted that Chris had the great idea of recording our conversation.
