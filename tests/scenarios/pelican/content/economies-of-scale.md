Title: Economies of Scale

Summary: In which I strongly critique Robert Gates' years-old comments on the cost of the B-2, because I'm a pedant.

I was reading through an interesting Ars Technica [article]() on the new Long
Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) proposal the Air Force is soliciting. It's generally
interesting to me in part because I've worked on a related project in the past,
and we talked fairly often about how the LRS-B program might impact it. The
article is worth your time. This quote from Robert Gates in the middle of the
article, which touches on the program the LRS-B would replace, caught my
attention, though:

> What we must not do is repeat what happened with our last manned bomber. By
> the time the research, development, and requirements processes ran their
> course, the aircraft, despite its great capability, turned out to be so
> expensive---$2 billion each in the case of the B-2---that less than one-sixth
> of the planned fleet of 132 was ever built.
> 
> Looking ahead, it makes little sense to pursue a future bomber---a prospective
> B-3, if you will---in a way that repeats this history. We must avoid a
> situation in which the loss of even one aircraft---by accident, or in
> combat---results in a loss of a significant portion of the fleet, a national
> disaster akin to the sinking of a capital ship. This scenario raises our costs
> of action and shrinks our strategic options, when we should be looking to the
> kind of weapons systems that limit the costs of action and expand our options.

Now, in one sense, Gates was absolutely right. On the other hand, he seems to
have committed a classic blunder in dealing with these kinds of costs: economies
of scale matter. Part of the reason the per-unit price of the B-2 was so high
was precisely that we only bought 20 of them. While the units were individually
expensive to manufacture and maintain, because of unique materials used in their
construction and so on, they were much *more* expensive to manufacture in small
numbers than they would have been in large numbers. There are basically two
reasons for this:

 1. The manufacturing process couldn't do what it does best (turn out large
    numbers of standardized parts and thereby reduce costs).
 2. The costs of developmentâ€”research, software development, etc.---were all
    distributed over a much smaller pool than they would have been had the
    government purchased more aircraft.

This second point is incredibly important to understand. It is certainly true
that the absolute cost of buying 132 B-2s would have been high, possibly
astronomically and unaffordably high. What it would *not* have been is $264
billion. Even assuming that manufacture costs were fully half of the cost-per-
plane (almost certainly not the case), it would have been barely over half that.
Assume that the B-2 cost $1B per plane to build, and that the other $10B was
research. Well, that's still an expensive plan... but the total cost is
something like $144B, not $264B. Those economies of scale matter.

This same reality is a point made later in the article by another commentator,
but I couldn't let it go. Things like this drive me nuts, because they're such a
common failing in our political discourse. Ignorance of basic economics from the
people making decisions with this kind of economic impact is profoundly unhelpful.
