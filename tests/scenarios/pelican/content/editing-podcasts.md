Title: On Editing Podcasts

    Good podcasts—like good blog posts—require planning, care, and editing.

    Most podcasts are more like blog posts than magazine articles. (That doesn't
    mean you shouldn't edit, them, though!)

Last week, Alan Jacobs posted [a few thoughts] on the overall quality of
podcasts. While he's [since acknowledged] that part of his challenge with
podcasts is that his bar is extremely high, I think his original piece bears
quoting and responding to briefly, including a few thoughts about how Stephen
and I handle [Winning Slowly][ws].

From his piece:

I actually happen to basically agree with those critiques. However, one category
he left out is: *people podcasting the way people blog*. And this is where many
of the most interesting podcasts I listen to come in. It's also basically where
Winning Slowly fits: you can think of our show like an audio version of a blog
post. It's not as carefully considered or edited as a long-form magazine piece
(or, in its respective medium, a professionally produced radio show). But like
blog posts, the fact that it's a bit more off the cuff and that it's *not* the
incredibly tight work that you find in a magazine can actually be attractive at
times. Many of my favorite podcasts are very conversational and not heavily
produced.

But---and here I think Jacobs is absolutely correct---all of the shows I really
enjoy make a point to edit their shows. They clean up the audio from artifacts,
they cut segments that were off topic, they make sure the levels are good
between the different members of the podcast, and so on. And while you don't
have to do those things to have a podcast, any more than you need to edit the
things you write to have a blog, you do need to do them if you want to have a
*good* show. Sadly, this is where a number of shows I otherwise might enjoy show
themselves to the door.

There is a reason Stephen and I spent a whole ["beta" season] of [Winning
Slowly][ws][^beta] working not only on what we wanted the show to be about, but
finding its voice and tone, the structure of the episodes, and the quality of
our audio. We wrestled with the audio output from mediocre microphones and
adopted seemingly silly practices like putting blankets over our heads and
microphones and laptops while recording so that we can get better sound spaces.
We have taken the time to learn about compression and limiting and other audio
editing techniques, and work hard to get the mix between our intro and outro
music and our own voices correct. And we cut things mercilessly.

["beta" season]: http://www.winningslowly.org/season-0.html

For example, here is the blooper reel from [3.05], which consists of only the
*funny* parts of what I cut from the show (there was probably as much again that
I just removed and didn't include):

[3.05]: http://www.winningslowly.org/3.05/

<audio class="media-embed" title="3.05 Bloopers" controls preload="metadata">
  <source src="http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.m4a/cdn.winningslowly.org/3.05-bloopers.m4a">
  <source src="http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.winningslowly.org/3.05-bloopers.mp3">
</audio>

That doesn't begin to touch all the "umms" and long pauses and overly heavy
breathing and do-overs we cut out (though, because this was a particularly rough
episode, it does give you an idea). The result, as I think most of our listeners
would agree, is a show that's pretty tight as far as the audio goes.

In terms of content, different shows will have a different feel, of course. Some
will require more planning. [New Rustacean], a new show on learning Rust I'm
hoping to launch later this week or early next week, requires a *lot* of
planning. [Sap.py], the fun little show my wife and I are about to launch, about
her adventures in learning Python, requires basically *no* planning. Winning
Slowly doesn't require a lot of formal planning, but it does require Stephen and
me to keep a good eye on ongoing stories in our fields of technology, religion,
ethics, and art, and to discuss big-picture ideas regularly and actively. Some
episodes, we outline carefully (like the one we recorded today, which will come
out next Tuesday). For others, we can basically just wing it (like the one we
recorded a week ago and which comes out tomorrow). But if our podcast is good,
and I really do think it is, it is because we take the time to work at making it
good. Just like you have to do on a blog, or really anything else in
life.[^difference]

[^difference]: One big difference between a podcast and a blog is that it
    actually takes a lot *more* work to make a good podcast than a good blog
    post. Audio editing is much more involved than editing writing, and speaking
    intelligently for any length of time---whether off the cuff, with a detailed
    outline, or as an interviewer---is much harder to get right than writing,
    where you can polish to your heart's content.

[^beta]: 13 published episodes, and one we dropped entirely!
