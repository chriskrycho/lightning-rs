Avid: [charging Sibelius users more money than ever for less value than
ever][link], after laying off their dev team a couple years ago just to maximize
profits.

This is *not* [Winning Slowly​] material here, folks. They lost me (and many
other) customers along the way, and they're headed further down that road here.

Subscription models for software can be valuable and reasonable—but the
providers have to justify them with product to match. Avid isn't, and hasn't
been. I've no doubt they're continuing to profit in the short term, but this
will no doubt erode their market position and waste an amazing product in the
long term. Greed destroys good things.
