 1. I broadly agree with the critique of the libertarian/TP angle on government
    as essentially an appendage to business. I am *by no means* hostile to the
    government in general or in principle, nor even to *spying*, nor even to
    warranted (double entendre intended) use of data for law enforcement. The
    idea that all government is bad is woefully incorrect; it is better to speak
    of *abuses*, either of government or of business or indeed of any sphere
    exceeding its right domain or acting inappropriately within its domain.

 2. There is a profound and important difference between corporate data
    collection and federal government data collection: one of them, people
    accede to directly (though see below); the other they accede to (at best!)
    indirectly through elected representatives, with whom they may profoundly
    disagree and against whom they have no recourse (unlike the case of, say,
    Google or Facebook—one *can* simply stop dealing with them). Whatever
    information I have granted to a corporation, I have chosen to grant them,
    and I can stop doing so with future information at any time. I *cannot* do
    so with the NSA, FBI, etc.

 3. That distinction may be relatively meaningless for most people in practice,
    given that the terms, means, and consequences of the data collection carried
    about by corporations are often obscure to the point of incomprehensibility.

 4. As such, a serious reformation ought to occur in the realm of business and
    the way that people's information is handled. Treating information about
    customers as the primary point of transactional value has significantly
    deleterious costs on any number of things.

 5. For this reason, I consistently advocate for and (where possible) choose to
    use services which are supported by direct payment, rather than by
    advertising, and so on. This is not always possible, but where it is, we
    should consider taking that path.

 6. Nonetheless, because of the government's power of coercion—a power not held
    by corporations, though to be sure they can exercise significant force of a
    certain sort through legal machinery/chicanery—the collection of metadata by
    the government does pose a more potent and long-term threat to liberty than
    that by corporations.

 7. As such, people are *absolutely right* to be more tolerant of corporate data
    collection than of federal data collection. That they ought to be less
    tolerant of corporate data collection by no means suggests that their
    hostility to unwarranted governmental data collection should be diminished:
    quite the contrary.

 8. Therefore, while some of the criticism of the government's data collection
    may well be driven by the sorts of corporate interests he suggests, and
    while much of the opposition from companies like Facebook and Google is
    indeed hypocritical, the criticism is still warranted. The NSA has clearly
    and repeatedly overstepped even the extremely wide bounds granted it by the
    Patriot Act, and the Patriot Act itself licensed behavior that should be
    horrifying to people concerned with the long-term effects of mass
    surveillance on governance.
