Another one in the music industry---but in this case, companies taking the long
view and advancing the [good of the whole community][link], rather than just
their own bottom line. (Spreadbury, the guy behind SMuFL, was one of the team
laid off in the [aforementioned] layoff from the Sibelius team, and now heads
the product development for a new notation software tool from Steinberg.)
