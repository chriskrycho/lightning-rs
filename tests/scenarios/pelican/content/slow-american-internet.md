Pretty damning of the current (lack of a) regulatory regime, if you ask me:

> According to a recent study by Ookla Speedtest, the U.S. ranks a shocking 31st
> in the world in terms of average download speeds. The leaders in the world are
> Hong Kong at 72.49 Mbps and Singapore on 58.84 Mbps. And America? Averaging
> speeds of 20.77 Mbps, it falls behind countries like Estonia, Hungary,
> Slovakia, and Uruguay.
