                                <p>What are your specific habits for journal/magazine/blog consumption? There are usual suspects that come through here, but are you subscribing to email newsletters, keep feeds, have a news aggregator, have tabs in a browser: what do you do and when do you consume it?
:   - <b>Books:</b> nonfiction I almost exclusively read in paper. Fiction I tend to read on my <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/eReaders">Kobo</a> these days. (I have an older model, the Kobo Aura ONE; I really like it.)</p>
<pre><code>- &lt;b&gt;Magazines:&lt;/b&gt; I’m subscribed to the paper copy of The Hedgehog Review; currently that’s about it. I tend to read pieces from The New Atlantis when they become available online; otherwise, I read a mix of things as they come across my radar.

- &lt;b&gt;Online reading:&lt;/b&gt; this goes in two buckets: feeds, and general reading.

    - &lt;b&gt;Feeds:&lt;/b&gt; I use [Feedbin] (because I prefer to pay for my services) and subscribe to a mix of feeds I find interesting (including a few Twitter feeds; it has a lovely feature where it turns threads into single entries in the feed reader); I mostly read those via [Unread] on my iPad.

    - &lt;b&gt;General:&lt;/b&gt; Whether I discover them via links in other things I read, links here and in similar online communities, or even just items in my feed,, I usually push longer-form things into [Pocket], because (and only because) you can sync it to a Kobo, which I do. Most sufficiently-long pieces online I end up reading on my Kobo as a result. When I like a piece, I “favorite” it which pushes it into [Pinboard] for later ease of lookup.[^pinboard]

- &lt;b&gt;Email newsletters:&lt;/b&gt; my subscriptions are fairly limited. I read [Michael Sacasas][sacasas], [Gracy Olmstead][olmstead], [Craig Mod][mod], [Ben Thompson][stratechery][^stratechery], and [Matt Levine][levine] (who is absolutely hilarious as well as deeply informative).

<p>At one point I was using Pinboard extensively to track things I’d read. I’m likely going to move away from that; at this point I do all of that tracking in <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a> instead… I just need to take the time to extract it and push it over into Bear in a way that will mesh well with my note-taking system. Also, what I’m doing with Pinboard at this point I could just as easily do in Pocket, so…</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="stratechery"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>I’m debating whether I’ll keep my membership to Stratechery next year, because while I really like it it’s also not cheap, and I’ve been looking at subscriptions I can cut.</p>
