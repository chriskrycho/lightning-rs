                                <p>I spent a little time this weekend working on getting the <abbr>URL</abbr>s for the web app version of <a href="https://rewrite.software"><b><i>re</i>write</b></a> working. I’m about 80% of the way done with it. For the last bit, I’ll be asking a bunch of questions of folks more experienced than me with <a href="https://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>: I can see ways to solve a particular challenge, but I don’t <em>like</em> any of them. This is just part of the normal process of learning a new technology: things go a bit more slowly because you don’t <em>already</em> know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>I had the thought today—not for the first time—that perhaps I should drop Elm and switch to just doing <a href="https://emberjs.com">Ember</a> and <a href="https://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>: technologies with which I’m <em>deeply</em> familiar and <em>very</em> competent. I could undoubtedly get the web app up and working faster that way, and I don’t have any particular interest in needlessly reinventing the wheel. As I mulled on the question on my run earlier, though, I came back to the same decision I have every time I have thought on this.</p>
<p>I’m building this thing in Elm on the web and with SwiftUI on iOS and macOS, even though it is <em>definitely</em> slower to get to market than just shipping an Ember-TypeScript-Electron app, because speed-to-market is not really a primary concern for me. I have the luxury of working on this on the side, and I want the result of my efforts in building it to be a code base that will last a decade or two. More than that: a code base I will be glad to work in for a decade or two.</p>
<p>The net is that I am choosing to go slower now in order to be able to build more, better, faster, more stably later. I know just how great Ember and TypeScript can be, but I also know that as good as they are, they’re both fundamentally limited by JavaScript itself. As I <a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/javascript-is-c.html" title="JavaScript is C">wrote</a> in late 2018, I firmly and deeply believe that we can do <em>better</em> than JavaScript. With <b><i>re</i>write</b>, I am putting my money where my mouth is. If I’m wrong, I can change course later. But if I’m right, doing this the slightly-slower way now will yield <em>enormous</em> dividends over the next fifteen years.</p>
<p>When your timescale is not 6 months of runway but <em>as long as it takes to make it good</em> there are downsides: it can lead to paralysis, or the endless pursuit of unattainable perfection. But it also has the very great upside of being able to build something <em>well</em>. We don’t build highway bridges overnight, because they have to endure. Too often, we <em>try</em> to build software overnight, without considering how it, too, may have to endure.</p>
