                                <p>From my reading this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>Feminism, capitalism, and AI.</i> In <a href="https://thebaffler.com/outbursts/the-wife-glitch-schaffer">The Wife Glitch</a>, Jennifer Schaffer argues that modern tech is about valuing “women’s work”… as a profit center for men. Lots of “capitalism does ” kinds of language, which undercuts a lot of the otherwise interesting points of the piece about how many specifically <em>domestic tasks</em> have been tackled by the tech renaissance. A huge blind spot, too: lots of very traditionally/stereotypically male tasks are <em>also</em> coming under fire, and targets of machine learning/AI programs (e.g. driving). Still, the argument was engaging and I’m not sad I read it, even if I ultimately disagree with her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Politics, journalism, sexual assualt.</i> Laura McGann explains at Vox just how difficult a story to report the Tara Reade accusations against Joe Biden have been. One of the things I appreciate about this piece in particular is that it highlights just how hard <em>good</em> journalism is. McGann explains some of the lengths she went to in her attempt to chase down information (and to help Reade prove her case if it’s true), and it’s a <em>lot</em>. Worth a read for that perspective alone. Also worth a read for the way it <em>appropriately</em> complicates the narrative around Reade and Biden—neither in partisan fashion leaping to Biden’s defense, nor blaming Reade for being an “imperfect witness,” nor even passing judgment on the case: just laying out the facts as well as McGann can.</p>

<p><i>Software rewrites.</i> <a href="https://increment.com/software-architecture/exit-the-haunted-forest/">This piece</a> (by John Millikin, on Stripe’s <cite>Increment</cite>) was a great dive into when and how to tackle actual software rewrites. One of the interesting things about this is that, while it argued against one of the long-standing pieces of wisdom in our industry—<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/" title="Things You Should Never Do, Part I">Joel Spolsky’s famous argument against rewrites</a>—it’s arguably just restating Martin Fowler’s post from just a few years later about <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html" title="StranglerFigApplication">how to do rewrites well</a>. Meta takeaway: this industry is pretty bad about actually learning the things we need to learn. (Maybe other industries are equally bad; I just have no insight into them.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Christianity and human dignity.</i> I don’t love D. B. Hart in general: I think he’s something of a blowhard. But <a href="https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/human-dignity-was-a-rarity-before-christianity/" title="Human Dignity Was a Rarity Before Christianity">this piece</a> (from back in 2017) was excellent: an articulation of just how profoundly Christianity has reshaped our notion of human dignity. Christianity was not the <em>origin</em> of these ideas, of course: Judaism had been proclaiming them for millennia by the time Christianity exploded from being a small messianic Jewish sect into the world religion that it became in the first few centuries A.D. But precisely that explosion transformed our whole approach to humanity. <em>Everyone</em>, we now affirm, deserves to be treated with equal dignity, has inherently equal worth and personhood—not as a matter of rank or family, but by dint of being human. You don’t have to be a Christian or even think much of what we Christians believe about the universe to appreciate that change (though I’d suggest that if you <em>do</em> appreciate that change, maybe consider what we think about the universe?).</p>

<p>Two other notes, in closing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I learned a <em>ton</em> this week about <a href="https://new.steinberg.net/dorico/">Dorico</a>, a bit about virtual instruments and how to tweak them, and a little bit—by way of experience, that best of teachers!—about orchestration. Composing all week was a lot of fun, even if I didn’t get quite as far as I might have liked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It strikes me that perhaps I should (re)title this series “Things I Read This Week” instead of “Things I Learned” since that’s <em>actually</em> how it’s functioning. Thoughts? <a href="mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com">Email me!</a></p>
