                                <p><em>CSS Grid blowout.</em>
: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/preventing-a-grid-blowout/">This article</a> has a great summary of a thing I had to figure out the hard way a couple days ago to fix the behavior of the <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/notes/">Notes</a> section of this site. Grid columns default to having the minimum width of their content, <code>auto</code>. This is reasonably fine for lots of kinds of items, but for images (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, pre-formatted text (<code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>), description/definition lists (<code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>) and likely others… not so much. Setting a concrete value with <code>minmax(0em, &lt;max value&gt;)</code> does the trick—and it doesn’t have to be <code>0em</code>; <em>any</em> minimum value will do it.</p>
<p><em>Conspiracy theories.</em>
: Ellen Cushing <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/i-was-a-teenage-conspiracist/610975/">details</a> both how she ended up deep in conspiracy theories as a teenager, and how she eventually ended up gradually slipping out of that world. HT: <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:ayjay">Alan Jacobs’ Pinboard</a>. I’ve been (we’ve <em>all</em> been, I expect) encountering more and more conspiracy-theorizing over the past few years, and never more so than since the arrival of COVID-19. This was a helpful and illuminating piece—even if it’s as unclear as always with memoir-style write-ups how much this one person’s experience generalizes to the masses: Cushing represents the person who ended up <em>recovering</em> from conspiracy-mind, while there are many others for whom it only gets worse over time. There is hope here, but it is of a limited sort.</p>
<p><em>Birds.</em>
: I’ve been watching the birds behind our house more and more over the last couple years. This year, we have a <em>bunch</em> of kinds of birds I’ve never seen before, and it has been fascinating to see each different species’ different behaviors. I’m not quite the bird-obsessive that my wife is (or that our cat is, albeit for very different reasons!), but I find them endlessly fascinating nonetheless. Jenny Odell’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/why-birds-do-what-they-do/610588/">double-review</a> of David Allen Sibley’s <cite>What It’s Like to Be a Bird: From Flying to nesting, Eating to Singing—What Birds Are Doing, and Why</cite> and Jennifer Ackerman’s <cite>The Bird Way: A new Look at How Birds Talk, Work, Play, Parent, and Think</cite> only increased my fascination. Birds do some pretty remarkable, pretty strange things.</p>
<p><em>Hacking.</em>
: Andy Greenberg with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-marcus-hutchins-hacker-who-saved-the-internet/">the absolutely wild story</a> of Marcus Hutchins—a hacker who did some pretty terrible things as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_(computer_security)">black-hat</a> in his mid-teens, but who has since done enormous good as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)">white-hat</a>. There’s a eucatastrophic bit at the end-so-far of this story that had me delighted.</p>
<p><em>Lynching.</em>
: Malcolm Foley <a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/ahmaud-arbery/">writes piercingly, wrenchingly, and with serious theological weight at <cite>Mere Orthodoxy</cite></a> on the killing of black men, women, and children under the pretext of justice—prompted by the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. (As my friend and the editor-and-chief at Mere O Jake Meador <a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/ahmaud-arbery-basics/">made abundantly clear with straightforward moral reasoning</a>: <em>whatever</em> Arbery was doing, and even in the <em>worst</em> possible light for him and the <em>best</em> possible light for the men who killed him, the killing was a murder.) Foley’s piece unflinchingly looks at the legacy of lynching in the church, and calls the church specifically to do <em>better</em> here.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; So then what can we do moving forward? Is there still a way for the church of Christ to be a beacon of hope in the midst of the encroaching and oppressive darkness of white supremacy? There are two: we must read our Bibles differently and we must act in our world differently.
&gt; 
&gt; Being a confessional Presbyterian, I have found much hope and beauty in the Westminster Standards. When asked why I, as a black man, attempt to remain in a communion which historically was the architect of my ancestors’ enslavement, I respond that I am so because of its doctrine and polity and in direct resistance to its history.

Amen.
