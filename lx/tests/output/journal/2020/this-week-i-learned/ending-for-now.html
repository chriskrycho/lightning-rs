                                <p>In April and May, inspired by <a href="https://redalemeden.com">Reda Lemeden</a>, I experimented with posting a weekly summary of the things I’d read that week, under the heading <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/topics/this-week-i-learned/">This Week I Learned</a>. In practice it was less “This week I learned” and more “This week I read,” but that was fine. Pretty quickly, though, I ran into the same basic issue that led me to <a href="https://buttondown.email/chriskrycho/archive/signing-off-across-the-sundering-seas-2020-26/">stop</a> publishing <a href="https://buttondown.email/chriskrycho">my newsletter</a>: time.</p>
<p>This is a slightly ridiculous (but very typical for me) case of a self-created problem and a self-imposed stricture, but I wanted to <em>actually</em> summarize <em>everything</em> I’d read and thought valuable to my readers (or my future self). It turns out that doing that takes a lot of time. (Who knew?) The work of writing it up each week was taking me an hour or more. And after about a month or so, I decided I needed to spend that time on other things. So, while I really enjoyed the experiment, I bid it <em>adieu</em>.</p>
<p>Perhaps at some much less busy and much less stressful point in the future I’ll pick it up again—or perhaps not. One of the great and lasting joys of a blog like this one is that it need only ever be exactly what I want of it at any given time!</p>
