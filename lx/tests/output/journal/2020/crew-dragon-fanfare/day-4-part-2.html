                                <p>After getting some revisions done <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/crew-dragon-fanfare/day-4-part-1/">earlier in the day today</a>, I was able to turn my attention to the next phase of this work, and the next (and probably final) major chunk of the piece of music. I spent a good bit of the evening noodling on the piano, playing over and over again through variations on the second riff I posted <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/crew-dragon-fanfare/day-1/">at the end of the first day</a>. And standing on my deck, thinking—because I was <em>stuck</em> and the best way forward was standing outside in the quiet, watching some birds, pacing back and forth and running through the sound in my head, because I wasn’t succeeding in getting it out into the piano (much less an orchestral score!).</p>
<p>Standing on my deck, pacing, playing the music in my head helped! When I went back to the piano, I was able to find a couple new interesting melodies—but then I was also able to find a new, better <em>rhythm</em>. This was the same basic process I went through for nailing down the sound for the opening fanfare on the morning of <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/crew-dragon-fanfare/day-2/">the second day</a>: taking the melodic progressions I had come up with already and getting them into the right shape <em>rhythmically</em>. It’s quite amazing how distinct the effect of the same sequence of pitches can be when set in different rhythmic relation.</p>
<p>I knew when I came back to the piano that I wanted to connect the sounds of the two sections a bit more directly—not just the harmonic patterns, but also the <em>feel</em> of them. The new rhythms I landed on do the trick nicely, as they’re a kind of variation on the rhythms from the fanfare. The difference: I removed some triplets in favor of two rhythms I use in the fanfare: sixteenth-sixteenth-eighth, and a dotted quarter note followed by a quarter note. It’s <em>much</em> improved.</p>
<p>With the new rhythms in place and a few new melodic and harmonic ideas (key change!), I also decided it would be helpful to survey the actual harmonies I ended up using in the fanfare, for easy reference. I fully expect to pull those back out more or less directly in this next section, and then to vary them.</p>
