                                <p>Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIZsnKGV8TE">SpaceX successfully launched</a> a Falcon 9 rocket with the Crew Dragon capsule on top, with astronauts. I was, to say the least, <a href="https://buttondown.email/chriskrycho/archive/spaaaaaaaaaace-across-the-sundering-seas-2020-22/">excited</a>. This is one of those moments that doesn’t just come along every day!</p>
<p>The launch was originally scheduled for Wednesday, and <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/crew-dragon-fanfare/day-7/">as I hoped</a>, I was able to actually finish it on the day of the launch. Not quite early enough to have <em>shared</em> it with SpaceX via social media… but then, <a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2019/breaking-up-with-social-media.html">I’m not on social media</a>, so I don’t actually know how I would have done it anyway.</p>
<p>I have a few further comments, but first, the music!</p>

<h2>Further thoughts</h2>
<p>Now that I have actually <em>completed</em> a draft of this piece, I have a bunch of further thoughts:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="#orchestration">Orchestration</a></li>
<li><a href="#revising">Revising</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Title</h3>
<p>You may have noticed if you looked at <a href="https://cdn.chriskrycho.com/file/chriskrycho-com/music/crew-dragon-2/day-8.pdf">the score</a> (today or previously) that the title on the page is <cite>Fanfare for a New Era of American Spaceflight</cite>. I titled the blog post series “Composing a Fanfare for Crew Dragon” because I did not actually have that title when I started work, but I like it. There is a long history of “Fanfare for…” and while this piece will never stack up next to something like Copland’s <cite>Fanfare for the Common Man</cite>, that’s at least the kind of thing I had in mind!</p>
<h3>Dorico</h3>
<p>Scoring in <a href="https://new.steinberg.net/dorico/">Dorico</a> is great! I’ve made good use of their 30-day trial, and I will definitely be purchasing <a href="https://new.steinberg.net/dorico/compare-editions/">Dorico Pro</a>. I intend to have a full review up in the next week or so, now that I’ve actually worked start to finish on a piece in it. The thing that continues to amuse me most is something that caught my attention within the first day or so of scoring with Dorico: despite not having used <a href="http://www.sibelius.com">Sibelius</a> in earnest in over a decade, I still reach for its keyboard shortcuts sometimes!</p>
<p>The next thing I’d really like to figure out is how to handle <em>playback</em> with a good deal more nuance. Dorico’s built in mapping from notation to MIDI expressions is very good, so this doesn’t sound terrible… but despite the quality of the <a href="https://new.steinberg.net/halion-symphonic-orchestra/">Halion Symphonic Orchestra</a> (HSO) samples, this recording is not going to fool anyone that this is a real orchestra for even a second. To <em>really</em> make this sound the way I want, I think I would need to export it over to <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic</a> (which I’m fairly familiar with, having used it for podcast editing for many years) and use a MIDI keyboard and actually learn all the ins and outs of MIDI expression mapping.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#hso-version">1</a></sup> I would <em>like</em> to do that, but I honestly don’t think I <em>should</em> spend the time to do it as things stand: I have <a href="https://rewrite.software">other projects</a> to work on!</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="hso-version"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>What’s more, to make using a DAW like Logic pay off, I’d also need to invest in the full version of HSO (or something like it): the version that comes with Dorico Pro is VST-only, with no AU support. That is no joke price-wise, and while it would definitely be worth it if I were going to be doing this <em>all the time</em>… I expect to be composing a few times a year going forward, not week in and week out.</p>

<h3>Orchestration</h3>
<p>I’m still going to plan to pick up an orchestration book. I’m reasonably pleased with how this came out—it is <em>substantially</em> the most interesting and careful orchestration work I have ever done—but I also found myself constantly aware of <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/crew-dragon-fanfare/day-2/">my gaps here</a>. My current plan is to pick up one or both of the volumes recommended to me by a couple professors of music composition I trust:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=qvtf8Hp8DGA&amp;mid=2653&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2FInstrumentation-and-Orchestration-Alfred-Blatter%2Fbook%2F47448528%3Fmatches%3D17"><cite>Instrumentation and Orchestration</cite></a>, Alfred Blatter</li>
<li><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=qvtf8Hp8DGA&amp;mid=2653&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2FThe-Study-of-Orchestration-Samuel-Adler%2Fbook%2F6423813%3Fmatches%3D43"><cite>The Study of Orchestration</cite></a>, Samuel Adler</li>
</ul>
<p>Again: it’s not that what I did on this particular piece was <em>bad</em>. To the contrary! I’m proud of it, and particularly of the fact that I meaningfully <em>improved</em> my orchestration over <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/enanthropoisis">the last things</a> I wrote <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/destiny-and-hope">for orchestra</a>.</p>
<p>Even so: working through some exercises would be helpful, I think. Perhaps even more importantly, getting a clearer handle mentally on the way that the pieces of the orchestra can work together in a technical sense would be <em>great</em>. I am profoundly grateful for my music theory classes—in this very piece I drew on things I learned about counterpoint in those classes almost fifteen years ago!—and I find in general that deep technical knowledge only <em>improves</em> one’s work in categories like this, at least once it is well and properly internalized.</p>
<h3>Revising</h3>
<p>I expect to revise this a bit over the next few weeks. I will probably listen to it as it stands <em>way</em> too many times over the next few days, then give myself some time away from it. Much as with writing <em>words</em>, I find it helpful when writing music to do a draft, then get some space and distance, then come back to it. Right in the aftermath of finishing a draft, I am too close to the material and it is easy to be precious about it and attached to it.</p>
<p>I don’t <em>expect</em> that I’ll make any large structural changes to the piece when I come back to it… but of course, I <em>would</em> say that today: I just finished it, and I’m feeling <em>very</em> precious about it! A few weeks or a month from now, I might just hear some things that need to work differently.</p>
<h3>Recording</h3>
<p>This is a long shot, but… if you happen to belong to (or lead!) an orchestra, and you like this piece enough that you would be interested in performing it, <a href="mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com?subject=fanfare"><em>please</em> email me</a>! For all that I hope to eventually be sufficiently competent with a DAW like Logic for its intended purpose of music production, I would always infinitely prefer a live recording of real musicians playing my music.</p>
