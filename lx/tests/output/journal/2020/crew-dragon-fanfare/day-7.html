                                <p>Although I failed to post about it (because we got busy doing other things), I <em>did</em> make more progress on this fanfare on Memorial Day. Sadly, I did <em>not</em> make any further progress after that and before the scheduled Crew Demo 2 launch… but it got scrubbed because there was too much electrical energy in the air. (Nobody wants a repeat of the time Apollo 12 got struck by lightning and experienced a brownout on its electrical circuits!)</p>
<p>I sat back down with the score tonight and made some tweaks to what I had done by the end of the day Monday, filled out a bunch of the orchestration, and then worked out another 8 seconds worth of music. Yes, just 8 seconds! With full orchestration, this stuff takes a while—at least for me.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#speed">1</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="speed"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>I’m sure that people who do this for a living can do it far faster than I can! I also have to say: Dorico makes this work go quicker than Sibelius ever did, but I’m definitely still developing the muscle memory for it!</p>
</div>
<p>At this point, it’s getting down to the home stretch. The orchestration in this final section is thickening out just the way I wanted; I’ve managed roughly the amount of thematic variation and development I was hoping for; it’s building to the climax (and I know roughly how that should work). If I work <em>really</em> hard tomorrow and Saturday morning in between other things… maybe I’ll finish it by the time they <em>actually</em> launch on Saturday.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here’s what I have as of tonight!</p>
