                                <p>After staying up <em>way</em> too late working on orchestration last night, I had a bit of a rough start to the day. And it’s already almost the end of the week! It occurred to me as I went back and finished polishing up the work I had done last night—tweaking here and there bits I knew needed it after listening to the recording a few times. I’m <em>mostly</em> happy with where it is now: there are a few very small tweaks I think I will make, but the piece as it stands is a solid second draft, and one I’d be very interested to hear a small orchestra play.</p>
<p>If you compare this to the recording I put up <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/crew-dragon-fanfare/day-3/">last night</a>, you’ll find that the differences are fairly subtle (you’ll probably be able to pull them out best by comparing the score <a href="https://cdn.chriskrycho.com/file/chriskrycho-com/music/crew-dragon-2/day-4a.pdf">as it stands today</a> to <a href="https://cdn.chriskrycho.com/file/chriskrycho-com/music/crew-dragon-2/day-3.pdf">how it was yesterday</a>), but they are there, and at least to my ear they make an important difference:</p>

<p>Given the course this week has taken and is taking—a <em>very</em> interrupted day today, in particular—I’ve contented myself with the fact that the <em>next</em> section of the piece will take longer to finish than I have time this week. (Days only have so many hours and weeks only have so many days in them, it turns out.) Happily, the opening fanfare works well enough as a standalone piece, so if life is so busy that I’m unable to finish the <em>rest</em> of it by the time of the launch, I can still publish this first part and be content.</p>
<p>That being so, I’m still going to spend the rest of the afternoon and tomorrow and some of Saturday working on the <em>second</em> part, so you can look forward to seeing and hearing more! And perhaps, Lord willing, I will be able to finish it and even learn enough about the subtleties of virtual instrument articulations to make it sound <em>good</em> before the launch in three weeks!</p>
