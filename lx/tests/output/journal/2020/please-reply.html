                                <p>I recently saw <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/replyin/">a note</a> from Ethan Marcotte that he’s added a little link to the end of his RSS feed to let you reply right there by just tapping the link. I love it. I’m stealing it!</p>
<p>One of the best things about running <a href="https://buttondown.email/chriskrycho">a newsletter</a> was that people would <em>reply</em>. It was like the best parts of social media without all the stupidity. <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/more-on-the-dish/">Email is great!</a> It’s terrible, too, especially in work contexts… but for this kind of thing, it’s mostly just great.</p>
<p>Having a reply link in my feeds gives you <em>almost</em> as seamless an experience as just being able to hit “Reply” in an email client—so I hope you’ll use it!</p>
