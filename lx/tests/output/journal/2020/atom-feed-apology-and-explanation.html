                                <p>Stop me if <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/json-feed-apology-and-explanation/">you’ve heard this before</a>: I made a mistake in setting up the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html">Atom feed</a> for this site, specifically around the IDs. A bunch of you probably just got a bunch of feed items in your reader again, and this post just exists as a spot for me to say “I’m very sorry!”—because I am. It’s extremely annoying when that happens.</p>
<p>This was just <a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/v5.chriskrycho.com/commit/afec3cfc87de4bbecf8df1c23b59f27f83f586e6">a dumb mistake</a> that was easily fixed, but it meant the IDs were fragile. I found it because I realized the titles were rendering badly in the <a href="https://us7.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=eeb568ecf8f5d9f2a2a1c9f24&amp;id=bccf52306b">mailing list</a> I have set up for this feed. It’s fixed now, and hopefully—<em>hopefully!</em>—this is the last time for the life of this implementation that you’ll hear anything from me about these feeds!</p>
