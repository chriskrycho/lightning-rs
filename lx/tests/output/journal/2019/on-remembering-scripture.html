                                <p>I recently got fed up with my inability to remember the location of specific passages of Scripture. I have a good memory, but it has been failing me here, and the reason why became very obvious once I started thinking about it: easily-accessible digital search. For years, now, I have had digital Bibles ready to hand (<a href="https://www.accordancebible.com">Accordance</a>, <a href="https://www.logos.com">Logos</a>, <a href="https://www.esv.org/Matthew+1/">the ESV website</a>, you name it). These are wonderful tools in many ways, and all of them have very functional search engines that make it easy to go from remembering a phrase to reading the passage in moments. I’m grateful!</p>
<p>But. It also means that I simply have not <em>needed</em> to exercise my own memory for that task, at all. The unsurprising result is that my memory for specific passages has atrophied sharply. What else would I expect? I’ve outsourced my own mental abilities to the computer.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#outsourcing">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I’m now actively working on <em>changing</em> this, because I <em>want</em> to be able to remember passages specifically—not just a vague sense of “this is somewhere in one of Paul’s letters.”</p>
<p>Some of the technophiles out there might wonder: <em>why?</em> We have tech around all the time, right? Well, for one thing: no, we <em>don’t</em> necessarily have tech around all the time. For another, I need it if I’m going to be licensed to preach.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#licensure">2</a></sup> But the most important of them is: I simply want to know Scripture better. Relying on digital search, all the other practicalities aside, means that I am <em>not</em> taking the time to deeply internalize God’s word to us. There is a real, and a very important, difference between knowing that the Bible roughly says something somewhere, and knowing <em>exactly</em> what it says and <em>where</em>… not least because the latter also often helps us remember <em>why</em>. (Context matters!) Learning it well enough to <em>remember</em> it has a formative effect, too: especially because truly knowing Scripture changes us.</p>
<p>So, going forward, I am making a point to actually learn, and remember, the location of passages in Scripture. I have started taking them down as notes when I need to look them up, and I intend to review those going forward for the sake of my memory.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#first-two">3</a></sup> Hopefully the net will be that I will be a better student-of-Scripture and therefore a better knower-of-God. Certainly my memory will improve a bit in this area, if I’m consistent!</p>

<p>There is an interesting point to trace out in more detail here, around the difference between computing-as-replacement of human abilities and computing-as-extension of human abilities.

<p>The PCA’s tests for licensure and ordination include a fairly rigorous Bible knowledge exam. This is part of what got me thinking about this.</p>
