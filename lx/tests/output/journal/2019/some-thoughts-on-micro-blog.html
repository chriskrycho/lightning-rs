                                <p>For the last few years, and particularly in the months since <a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2019/breaking-up-with-social-media.html">I left Twitter</a>, I have been thinking about <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>. I like the idea—I like it a <em>lot</em> in fact. Manton Reece, the founder, has intentionally eschewed scale in favor of a much more human-sized network, based on <a href="http://www.indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> principles from the outset. He and his team have carefully eschewed the things that encourage the worst behavior on Twitter—retweets, like counts, follower counts. He has had a clear and sustainable business model from the beginning, too: it’s free to post from your own existing domain using an <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html">RSS</a>, <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html">Atom</a>, or <a href="https://jsonfeed.org">JSON Feed</a>, or it’s $5/month for micro.blog hosting.</p>
<p>In short, if you are going to be on a public social network at all, I think micro.blog is a <em>great</em> choice. But that’s the fundamental question: <i>do I want to be on a social network at all?</i></p>
<p>The answer I came to back in June was very simple: no.</p>
<p>A few things have prompted me to keep mulling on that choice. One is a recent internet acquaintance’s <a href="http://resident-theologian.blogspot.com/2019/11/a-twitter-amendment.html">posts on the subject</a>. Another is ongoing reflection how I want this website to work going forward—including setting up some of the more “social” elements of things, like <a href="https://webmention.net">Webmentions</a>. Not least is the consideration that I largely elided in my original essay on the subject, but which is the one thing that makes social media so compelling: I have interacted with people via social media with whom I would never otherwise have interacted, and it has made an enormously positive difference in my life.</p>
<p>Weighing the costs and benefits of decisions like these is difficult. For now, for all the reasons outlined in my original post—and a few more that have become apparent over the course of the writing I did last month—I think even something as carefully constructed as micro.blog is bad <em>for me</em>. That qualifier matters, though. It might not be bad for <em>you</em>. And if Twitter looked more like micro.blog, it would certainly be better for <em>everyone</em>. For me, for now, though, even something as carefully crafted as micro.blog would simply end up being a drain on energies I already find myself lacking: energies for writing longform, energies for <em>reading</em> longform, energies for building software myself.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#posse">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Maybe at some point micro.blog will be safe for me. Maybe there will come a day when doing like my acquaintance Brad is doing and allowing myself thirty minutes once a week would be the right move. For now, however, I continue to say <em>no</em> to public social media of all kinds, and to be conflicted even about my use of “private” social media like the Slack groups I am a part of. The cost for my mental energy is just too high.</p>

<p>I am, for now at least, <a href="https://micro.blog/chriskrycho">syndicating my post content there</a>, in line with the <a href="http://www.indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> principle. It does no harm along the lines I have identified as being most an issue for me—and it quietly supports Manton and co.’s efforts in what I think is a very healthy direction.</p>
