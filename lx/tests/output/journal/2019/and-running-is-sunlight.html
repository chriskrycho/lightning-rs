                                <p>Yesterday I wrote at some length about how severely travel impacts my ability to keep up my normal routines. As I hoped, reflecting and planning a bit at the end of that post was a helpful bit of motivation today. I got up this morning and did a new variant on my push-up routine,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#push-ups">1</a></sup> and then make a point to get out for a run early this afternoon. It helped. It helped a <em>lot</em>!</p>
<p>I had the very odd and very funny experience of starting the run and feeling what I can only describe as an anticipatory jolt of endorphins. People talk about getting “runner’s high” but I don’t really experience it: I’ve experienced it only a handful of times in the 9½ years I’ve been running. Today, though, I got a little bit of it… right in the first few steps, and indeed for much of the first mile.</p>
<p>The experience was telling. I have deeply accustomed my body to running, so much so that when I do <em>not</em> run, I feel off across the board. I end up feeling more physically tired, and also in a bit of a funk emotionally. The feeling is not all that different from the withdrawals I have when I stop drinking coffee—as I have this week.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#caffeine">2</a></sup> The big difference? On my third day of not drinking coffee, I’m back to normal: no more more headaches, no more fatigue, no more irritability to fight. Caffeine withdrawals are annoying, but they go away fairly quickly.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#decaf">3</a></sup> The impact of not running, or even of just running <em>less</em> than I normally do, goes on for much longer and is much worse.</p>
<p>I’m hoping that that experience will hammer home <a href="TODO%E2%80%94SSC">emotionally</a> for me what I’ve long known intellectually: I do better—much better—when I’m running. That not only includes when I’m traveling; it actually goes double when traveling! That feeling will, I hope, help me stay motivated to get out for a run more consistently, and thereby to do better at <em>everything</em> surrounding travel, going forward.</p>
<p>A final note, illustrating the point here: whereas until yesterday’s post I had managed no writing at all on this trip, today alone I have written over 1,200 words between this post and a long note in my <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/topics/Zettelkasten/">Zettelkasten</a>. </p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="push-ups"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Since the start of the year, I have been doing as many consecutive push-ups as I can <em>some</em> number of mornings out of the week. For roughly the first half of the year, that was six days a week. Since then, it has varied. Part of it was that I lost my routine when Jaimie and I went to Jamaica to celebrate our 10th anniversary. Part of it, though, was that I got <em>bored</em>. The new routine, starting today, is doing 100 consecutive push-ups of the hard-and-fast variety I have been doing all year, taking a minute to reset, and then doing a long, slow, touch-my-nose-to-the-ground variety, where each rep takes about 5 seconds instead of less than a single second. It’s a <em>very</em> different workout—which is just what I needed.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="caffeine"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Because I am such a coffee snob that I just can’t do the coffee available where I am this week.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="decaf"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">3</sup>
<p>I hate having a mild caffeine addition, because I do not in general drink coffee <em>for</em> the caffeine. The previous footnote likely makes more sense in light of this reality: I drink coffee because I love the <em>taste</em> of truly good coffee. If I could consistently get top-notch single-origin <em>decaf</em> coffees, I’d do that all the time and nothing else. As such, I was delighted when <a href="TODO">Counter Culture</a> started occasionally selling some single-origin decafs this year.</p>
