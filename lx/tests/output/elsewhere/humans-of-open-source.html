                                <p>I had the great pleasure of being <a href="%7B%7Blink%7D%7D">the inaugural guest</a> on Sean Chen’s new podcast, <a href="https://pod.co/humans-of-open-source">Humans of Open Source</a>. We chatted about all sorts of things around open source software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian humanism and the big picture of open source as digital infrastructure</li>
<li>open source “guilt”</li>
<li>codes of conduct</li>
<li>working on projects in public</li>
<li>the tension between open source as a good and making money from projects</li>
</ul>
<p>If that sounds interesting, <a href="%7B%7Blink%7D%7D">give it a listen</a>! And if you enjoy it, consider subscribing—I for one am quite interested to see where Sean takes the show!</p>
