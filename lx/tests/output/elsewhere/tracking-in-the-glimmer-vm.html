                                <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://pzuraq.com">Chris Garrett</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pzuraq">@pzuraq</a>) and I spent an hour talking about how autotracking and the Glimmer/Ember template layer connect. As the tech lead for Octane on the LinkedIn.com app, I needed to get a better handle on this so I can help <em>explain</em> it (and for a blog post I’m working on!). But it’s useful for <em>anyone</em> who wants to understand more of Glimmer works—so I’m delighted that Chris had the great idea of recording our conversation.</p>
