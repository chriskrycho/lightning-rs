                                <p>This is, perhaps, a little odd, but: one of the little things I’m most excited about with <a href="https://winningslowly.org">Winning Slowly</a> right now is that—at long last, and years overdue—we’re actually <em>doing something</em> with Patreon. We’ve had it, and had minor benefits for it for a long time. Now we’re taking it seriously: keeping it up to date, publishing extra materials there, etc. Crazy talk, I know!</p>
