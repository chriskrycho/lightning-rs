                                <p>I really, really wish GitHub had a slightly lower entry point for Teams/Organizations. I’d like to do everything for <a href="https://rewrite.software">rewrite</a> in a single organization on GitHub, rather than all under … but $25/month is frankly kind of steep for one developer. I’d be happy paying $10/month for <em>just</em> organization management, with the jump to $25 for supporting multiple developers. As is, though… GitLab looks appealing, whatever its other weaknesses.</p>
