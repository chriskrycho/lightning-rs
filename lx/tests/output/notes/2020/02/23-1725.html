                                <p>I’ve spent a good chunk of this afternoon working through and tweaking and fixing some things about this website, and as much as I like <a href="https://11ty.dev">11ty</a>, at this point I would <em>love</em> to be doing this work in <a href="https://elm-lang.org">Elm</a> instead. A tool like <a href="https://elm-pages.com">elm-pages</a> seems <em>very</em> appealing.</p>
<p>As for why: I just spend a lot of time sad about JS “sorry bro that’s <code>undefined</code>” stuff and templates being totally type-unaware. Even something like Gatsby + TS would probably be better here, but Elm’s rigor and top-to-bottom integration of types and rendered HTML and CSS would be a huge win for the way I build websites.</p>
