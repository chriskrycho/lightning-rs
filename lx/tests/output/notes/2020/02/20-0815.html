                                <p>I just got curious so I looked up: Winning Slowly has published 120 episodes in the last 6 years! Sloooow but steady (as is only right ðŸ˜‚). Averages out to ~20/year, which is surprisingly high given the last couple years, but we were churning them out fast those first couple seasons.</p>
