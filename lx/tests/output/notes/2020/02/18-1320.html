                                <p>One thing that makes me eager to upgrade to the next-gen iPad when it comes out (â€¦and Iâ€™m actually seriously contemplating the 12.9â€³ this time around) is how <em>fabulous</em> it is to be able to do the entire workflow for things like cameras on it with just normal cables.</p>
<p>It is already my default device for photo editing (Lightroom on iPad is ðŸ’¯) and I think itâ€™s going to be my default for podcast editing after having done <a href="https://winningslowly.org">Winning Slowly</a> 8.03 in <a href="https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/">Ferrite</a>. (To anyone interested in podcasting, Iâ€™d absolutely recommend Ferrite over anything else out there at this point. The experience of editing a podcast with that app and an Apple Pencil is just phenomenal.)</p>
