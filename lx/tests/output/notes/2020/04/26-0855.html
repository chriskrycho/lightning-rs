                                <p>Between my new <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/topics/this-week-i-learned/">This Week I Learned</a> entries, an interest in having all my notes in one place, and a desire to actually <em>use</em> my notes system more effectively I’m trying something new with my reading: notable things I read (and my comments on them) will now live in <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a> instead of <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>. I expect this will help a lot with <em>active review</em> of my reading notes. (I may go ahead and do something I’ve thought about for a while and pull all of my Pinboard notes over to Bear, too!)</p>
