                                <p>I just updated <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/this-week-i-learned-1/">the first entry</a> in my “This Week I Learned” series because I realized I’d left off a couple items I meant to include—the first items I bracketed for inclusion, in fact! What can I say? It was a long week. 😅</p>
