                                <p>Quick Git tip: if you’ve manually edited your Git configuration file and removed a given remote, you may find yourself in a spot where you now have a bunch of <em>branches</em> associated with that remote… which you cannot delete. The only way (I could find) out of this problem was to re-add the remote, and then run <code>git remote rm &lt;the name of the remote&gt;</code>. That deleted the remote <em>and</em> all the references to its branches</p>
