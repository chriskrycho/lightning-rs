                                <p>Wanted: something like <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/">The Archive</a>, but for iOS. <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a> is beautiful and I love it, but I want my notes <em>on disk</em> because then I can do anything with them from anywhere—not just what one app can come up from. (And yes, a document object model like people dreamt of in the 90s would also solve this well, but for today I’ll take what I can get.)</p>
<p>And yes, this <em>is</em> what I’m working on with <a href="https://rewrite.software">rewrite</a>.</p>
