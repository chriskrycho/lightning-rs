                                <p>Iâ€™m not <em>quite</em> sure how this had never occurred to me before the last week or so, but I ordered some refills for <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-UMR-83-Gel-Pen-Refill-0.38-mm-Black/pd/1660">my current favorite gel pen</a> and it only at that point occurred to me that I could put those refills in a different pen <em>case</em>. ðŸ˜‚ At some point Iâ€™ll have to try that.</p>
