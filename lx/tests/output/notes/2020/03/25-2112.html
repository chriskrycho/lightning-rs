                                <p>Trying out cursor support on iPad OS 13.4 for the first time this evening, as well as having remapped Caps Lock to Ctrl (as it should be), andâ€¦ the experience is simultaneously incredibly <em>delightful</em> and really, really weird. Weird in a good way, but weird.</p>
