                                <p>I spent more time on <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/autotracking-elegant-dx-via-cutting-edge-cs/">this ~2,000-word post</a> than any I’ve published in the last year. Net, I probably wrote around 8,000 words to get it down to the correct 2,000 in the end. And I’m still <em>barely</em> satisfied with it. Writing, people.</p>
