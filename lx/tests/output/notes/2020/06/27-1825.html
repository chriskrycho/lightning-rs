                                <p>This year’s updates to SwiftUI have me actually a little happy I <em>didn’t</em> make more progress on <b><i>re</i>write</b> over the last year. The story is much, much more complete and robust. Hopefully I can use it to build that much more quickly <em>this</em> year.</p>
