                                <p>I was hoping for a pleasant afternoon implementing a <a href="https://markdown-it.github.io">markdown-it</a> plugin for “line blocks” to support poetry. It was… not a pleasant afternoon.</p>
<p>markdown-it is fast, but between its API design (<em>:shudder:</em>) and its mostly-missing docs (<em>:sigh:</em>) it’s <em>terrible</em> to work with. I quit.</p>
