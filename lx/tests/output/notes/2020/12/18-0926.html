                                <p>I have gotten spoiled over the last decade by tools like <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> which let me assemble a final document from a set of smaller documents. Working with Google Docs for workâ€¦ there is just <em>none</em> of that. One more thing I dislike about Google Docs.</p>
