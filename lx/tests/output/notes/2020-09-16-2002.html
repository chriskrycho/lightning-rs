                                <p><a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com">Mere Orthodoxy</a>—“defending nuance and word counts on the internet since 2005” and my favorite Christian publication anywhere period at this point—has launched a <a href="%7B%7Blink%7D%7D">Kickstarter</a>! I’m proud to have been published in its pages a few times over the years, and hope that this crowdfunding campaign succeeds such that I can actually be published in its <em>physical pages</em> in the years ahead.</p>
