                                <p>We really, <em>really</em> need server-side template languages to catch up to, you know, 2014, where components are a thing and you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Quote @src={{this.book}} @loc='p. 123'&gt;
Look ma! Content *within* a *component*!
&lt;/Quote&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Nunjucks/Jinja macros are the closest I’ve seen and… they’re not even close in terms of expressivity. This is why people build things with React/Vue/Ember/etc. <em>just for server-side stuff</em>: because the DX is miles ahead.</p>
