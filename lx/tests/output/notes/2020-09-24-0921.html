                                <p>Every so often, I try to switch back to <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a>, because Sublime is <em>so</em> much faster and lighter-weight. But the feature gap is just too big at this point. What I still—desperately—want: an editor with Code’s extensibility, but truly Mac-native and <em>fast</em>. (<a href="https://onivim.io">Onivim</a> and <a href="https://panic.com/nova/">Nova</a>: both interesting, but not quite there in various ways.)</p>
