                                <p>I can’t really listen to podcasts or watch talks and <em>work</em> at the same time. I also can’t watch talks and walk or run at the same time. What I <em>can</em> do is <em>listen</em> to talks and walk or run at the same time. But there are a lot of great talks I want to learn from!</p>
<p>Solution: <a href="https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a> plus <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> Premium’s file uploads feature. Boom.</p>
