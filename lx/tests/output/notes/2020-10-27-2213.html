                                <p>Did my civic duty and voted this evening. One takeaway: there is an enormous gap in information about local politics. (Good luck finding out anything about a county judgeâ€™s record without just reading the court records yourself.) The internet effectively killed the previous version of local newspapers, and their replacement has yet to appear.</p>
