<p>My admittedly more low-flying project focuses on the motivational structure of an ethic: of citizenship. But it does not retreat from conflicting stories about human nature, the world, and God that characterizes some of these disputes. This inquiry, which finds Augustinianism both within and against modernity, may be less dramatic than grand narratives of declension or progress. Such narratives, however, are inconsistent with an Augustinian sensibility about the mixed moral qualities of any age and the need to always remain open to the gifts that others might bear.</p>
