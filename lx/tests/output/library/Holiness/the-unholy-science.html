<p>Dogmatics is often caricatured as the unholy science that reduces the practices of piety to lifeless propositions. But far from it: dogmatics is that delightful activity in which the Church praises God by ordering its thinking towards the gospel of Christ. Set in the midst of the praise, repentance, witness and service of God’s holy people, dogmatics—like all Christian theology—directs the Church’s attention to the realities which the gospel declares and attempts responsibly to make those realities a matter of thought.</p>
