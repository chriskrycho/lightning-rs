<blockquote>
<p>How shall we characterize the triune Creator’s active relating to creation? As a free relating that in attentive delight constitutes creatures in being, each and all–as a delighting in each and all, a delighting in which God commits Godself to creation and its well-being in orderly proximate contexts. This is the ultimate context into which we are born: God’s hospitable generosity, creatively relating, to us, free of creatures in creating and attentively delighting in them in their otherness to God, self-committed to that which is created.</p>
