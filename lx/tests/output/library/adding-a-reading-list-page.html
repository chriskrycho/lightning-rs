                                <p>A quick note for readers interested in the <a href="/library/">Library</a> section of my site: I’ve just added a new page to the site where I track <a href="/library/reading-list/">my reading list</a>.</p>
<p>There is no feed for it because it is just a single page, which I’ll keep mostly current, as a convenient reference for perusers of the site. Most items on that page will get referenced in the feeds <em>anyway</em>, by way of reviews or excerpts or the like. The new page will always have links to any and all of my reviews, Winning Slowly discussions, or other interactions with the texts.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
