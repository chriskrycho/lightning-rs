                                <p>When <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org">Alan Jacobs</a> recommends an author of fiction, you should take him seriously. Robin Sloan’s <a href="%7B%7Bbook.link%7D%7D"><cite>Sourdough</cite></a> is the second thing Jacobs has recommended that I’ve read—the first being Kim Stanley Robinson’s <cite>Red Mars</cite>—and in both cases I’ve come away more than happy that I heeded Jacobs’ advice.</p>
<p><cite>Sourdough</cite> is not a complicated book. I think it’s sci-fi, barely. It’s definitely contemporary fiction: the setting is unmistakably Silicon Valley in the present—with all its many beauties and horrors. The fascination with hacking our way into the future (and the <a href="https://winningslowly.org/8.06/">ruthless optimism</a> that we can do just that), the drive to put a particular class of technological advancement in front of every other human concern, the sheer unimaginable wealth involved in the pursuit of a technocracy perfected, and—especially—the confused notion that age-old human practices like <em>cooking</em> and <em>eating</em> and <em>spending time with friends</em> are outmoded and in desperate need of technological replacement: somehow, Sloan gets all of that in this slim little novel which made me laugh out loud more than any other book I can remember reading in the last decade.</p>
<p>Perhaps equally magical: he does it without a hint of malice or spite. “This is folly,” he seems to say, “but maybe the best way to make that clear is to laugh at it a bit and paint a picture of something lovelier still.” The result was a good novel, but a <em>great</em> book.</p>
