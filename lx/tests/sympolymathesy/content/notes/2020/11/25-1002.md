Just set up scheduled builds for this site using [Netlify] and [GitHub Actions] \(following [this handy guide][guide]) so that I can schedule drafts for the future and have them go live automatically.[^1] Itâ€™s pretty astounding how great these kinds of free tools are at this point.

[^1]: I know, this comes for free with [WordPress], [Ghost], etc. I like my static site generator, though: no server to manage is a big win.
