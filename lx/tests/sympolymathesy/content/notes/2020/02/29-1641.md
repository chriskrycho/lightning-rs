I really, really wish GitHub had a slightly lower entry point for Teams/Organizations. I’d like to do everything for [rewrite](https://rewrite.software) in a single organization on GitHub, rather than all under … but $25/month is frankly kind of steep for one developer. I’d be happy paying $10/month for *just* organization management, with the jump to $25 for supporting multiple developers. As is, though… GitLab looks appealing, whatever its other weaknesses.
