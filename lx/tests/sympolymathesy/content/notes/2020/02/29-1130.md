A quick sketch of an idea which I hope to test out by the end of the day: the best way to handle “responsive” *routing* in an [Elm] app—for a master-detail view where the master view isn’t visible when at a detail route on screens below a sufficient size—is to just use a [port] and send a message on screen size change.
