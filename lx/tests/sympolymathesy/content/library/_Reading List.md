I keep this page fairly current; it was last updated on {% localeDate page.date, 'MMMM d, yyyy' %}.

- The section for each year includes all the books I read that year (including the current year), in the order I finished the books.
- Books are marked “(new)” if this was the first time I read them, or “(reread)” otherwise.
- I separate out fiction and non-fiction not because I value them differently, but because they just *are* very different.
- Links on the books themselves are affiliate links to Alibris!
