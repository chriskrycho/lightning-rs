    summary: >
        Blake Crouch’s <cite>Recursion</cite> was the first thriller I’ve read in a long time—and it didn’t let me down. Its interest in identity and memory made it more than just a thriller, and I’m glad I read it.

Over my Christmas vacation, I picked up and read two of Blake Crouch’s novels: <cite>Recursion</cite> and <cite>Dark Matter</cite>. <cite>Recursion</cite> is the more recent of the two, published just this year, but the one I read first. It’s a romp of a book, a sci-fi thriller that pushes on questions of personal identity and memory and the relationship between the lives we have lived and the ways we remember them. The characters were fun and well-drawn; the plot twists always made sense; the conclusion *worked*.

The value of that last bit is hard to overstate: I generally don’t read thrillers because the handful I *have* read left a bad taste in my mouth with their dissatisfying endings. <cite>Recursion</cite> doesn’t have that problem, thankfully. I read it start to finish over the span of just a few days, and enjoyed it so much that I immediately picked up <cite>Dark Matter</cite> to read as well.

My favorite thing about the book is that it was *about* something: it wasn’t just a thriller, but a thriller interested in those questions of identity and memory. It was still popcorn, but… popcorn with a side of mashed potatoes or something like that.
