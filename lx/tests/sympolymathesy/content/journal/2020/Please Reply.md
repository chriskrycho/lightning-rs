I recently saw [a note][em] from Ethan Marcotte that he’s added a little link to the end of his RSS feed to let you reply right there by just tapping the link. I love it. I’m stealing it!

One of the best things about running [a newsletter][atss] was that people would *reply*. It was like the best parts of social media without all the stupidity. [Email is great!][email] It’s terrible, too, especially in work contexts… but for this kind of thing, it’s mostly just great.

Having a reply link in my feeds gives you *almost* as seamless an experience as just being able to hit “Reply” in an email client—so I hope you’ll use it!
