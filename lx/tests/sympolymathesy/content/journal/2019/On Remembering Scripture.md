I recently got fed up with my inability to remember the location of specific passages of Scripture. I have a good memory, but it has been failing me here, and the reason why became very obvious once I started thinking about it: easily-accessible digital search. For years, now, I have had digital Bibles ready to hand ([Accordance](https://www.accordancebible.com), [Logos](https://www.logos.com), [the ESV website](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+1/), you name it). These are wonderful tools in many ways, and all of them have very functional search engines that make it easy to go from remembering a phrase to reading the passage in moments. I’m grateful!

But. It also means that I simply have not _needed_ to exercise my own memory for that task, at all. The unsurprising result is that my memory for specific passages has atrophied sharply. What else would I expect? I’ve outsourced my own mental abilities to the computer.[^outsourcing]

I’m now actively working on _changing_ this, because I _want_ to be able to remember passages specifically—not just a vague sense of “this is somewhere in one of Paul’s letters.”

Some of the technophiles out there might wonder: _why?_ We have tech around all the time, right? Well, for one thing: no, we _don’t_ necessarily have tech around all the time. For another, I need it if I’m going to be licensed to preach.[^licensure] But the most important of them is: I simply want to know Scripture better. Relying on digital search, all the other practicalities aside, means that I am _not_ taking the time to deeply internalize God’s word to us. There is a real, and a very important, difference between knowing that the Bible roughly says something somewhere, and knowing _exactly_ what it says and _where_… not least because the latter also often helps us remember _why_. (Context matters!) Learning it well enough to *remember* it has a formative effect, too: especially because truly knowing Scripture changes us.

So, going forward, I am making a point to actually learn, and remember, the location of passages in Scripture. I have started taking them down as notes when I need to look them up, and I intend to review those going forward for the sake of my memory.[^first-two] Hopefully the net will be that I will be a better student-of-Scripture and therefore a better knower-of-God. Certainly my memory will improve a bit in this area, if I’m consistent!

[^outsourcing]: There is an interesting point to trace out in more detail here, around the difference between computing-as-replacement of human abilities and computing-as-extension of human abilities. Got essays or books on the topic? [Please send them my way!](mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com?subject=computing-as-replacement)

[^licensure]: The PCA’s tests for licensure and ordination include a fairly rigorous Bible knowledge exam. This is part of what got me thinking about this.

[^first-two]: The first two, last night: 1 Corinthians 6:19–20 and Matthew 22:29–30.
