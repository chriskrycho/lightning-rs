# Lightning JSON Feed (`lx-json-feed`)

This crate supplies a [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org) v1.1 implementation as part of the [lightning-rs](https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs) static site generator. Right now, this crate is not published independently, because (among other things) it's still a work in progress. Should that change, I'll consider publishing it.

## Prior art

There is an existing Rust crate, [jsonfeed](https://github.com/pwoolcoc/jsonfeed), which provides similar functionality. However, it is "still alpha" as of May 2017 and I wanted to be able to work quickly and make changes easily so that I could just get Lightning working.
