# Appveyor configuration template for Rust, borrowed from starkat99, with thanks!
# https://github.com/starkat99/appveyor-rust

version: '{build}'
branches:
  only:
  - master

## Operating System (VM environment) ##

# Rust needs at least Visual Studio 2013 Appveyor OS for MSVC targets.
os: Visual Studio 2015

## Build Matrix ##

# This configuration will setup a build for each channel & target combination (12 windows
# combinations in all).
#
# There are 3 channels: stable, beta, and nightly.
#
# Alternatively, the full version may be specified for the channel to build using that specific
# version (e.g. channel: 1.5.0)
#
# The values for target are the set of windows Rust build targets. Each value is of the form
#
# ARCH-pc-windows-TOOLCHAIN
#
# Where ARCH is the target architecture, either x86_64 or i686, and TOOLCHAIN is the linker
# toolchain to use, either msvc or gnu. See https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html#win-foot for
# a description of the toolchain differences.
#
# Comment out channel/target combos you do not wish to build in CI.

### MSVC Toolchains ###

  # Stable 64-bit MSVC
    - channel: stable
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
  # Stable 32-bit MSVC
    - channel: stable
      target: i686-pc-windows-msvc
  # Beta 64-bit MSVC
    # - channel: beta
    #   target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
  # Beta 32-bit MSVC
    # - channel: beta
    #   target: i686-pc-windows-msvc
  # Nightly 64-bit MSVC
    - channel: nightly
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
  # Nightly 32-bit MSVC
    - channel: nightly
      target: i686-pc-windows-msvc

### GNU Toolchains ###

  # Stable 64-bit GNU
    # - channel: stable
    #   target: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
  # Stable 32-bit GNU
    # - channel: stable
    #   target: i686-pc-windows-gnu
  # Beta 64-bit GNU
    # - channel: beta
    #   target: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
  # Beta 32-bit GNU
    # - channel: beta
    #   target: i686-pc-windows-gnu
  # Nightly 64-bit GNU
    # - channel: nightly
    #   target: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
  # Nightly 32-bit GNU
    # - channel: nightly
    #   target: i686-pc-windows-gnu

### Allowed failures ###

# See Appveyor documentation for specific details. In short, place any channel or targets you wish
# to allow build failures on (usually nightly at least is a wise choice). This will prevent a build
# or test failure in the matching channels/targets from failing the entire build.
matrix:
  allow_failures:
    - channel: nightly

# If you only care about stable channel build failures, uncomment the following line:
    #- channel: beta

# 32-bit MSVC isn't stablized yet, so you may optionally allow failures there (uncomment line):
    #- target: i686-pc-windows-msvc

## Install Script ##

# This is the most important part of the Appveyor configuration. This installs the version of Rust
# specified by the 'channel' and 'target' environment variables from the build matrix. By default,
# Rust will be installed to C:\Rust for easy usage, but this path can be overridden by setting the
# RUST_INSTALL_DIR environment variable. The URL to download rust distributions defaults to
# https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/ but can overridden by setting the RUST_DOWNLOAD_URL environment
# variable.
#
# For simple configurations, instead of using the build matrix, you can override the channel and
# target environment variables with the -channel and -target script arguments.
#
# If no channel or target arguments or environment variables are specified, will default to stable
# channel and x86_64-pc-windows-msvc target.
#
# The file appveyor_rust_install.ps1 must exist in the root directory of the repository.
install:
- ps: .\scripts\appveyor_rust_install.ps1

# Alternative install command for simple configurations without build matrix (uncomment line and
# comment above line):
#- ps: .\appveyor_rust_install.ps1 -channel stable -target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

## Build Script ##

# 'cargo test' takes care of building for us, so disable Appveyor's build stage. This prevents
# the "directory does not contain a project or solution file" error.
build: false

# Uses 'cargo test' to run tests. Alternatively, the project may call compiled programs directly or
# perform other testing commands. Rust will automatically be placed in the PATH environment
# variable.
test_script:
- cmd: cargo test --verbose
